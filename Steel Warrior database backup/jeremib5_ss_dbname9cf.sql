Also, you are giving up a lot of ac in some slots. Replace the stat bracers with FH, Djarns ring with Valorium or Steely. If you can swing it Hvy Rubicite or FH belt + CoF is better than pernicity + soulscream. There\'s a quested clone of the CoF available in SolC.<br/>\nGaspie<br/>\n01-29-2005, 09:14 PM<br/>\nDon\'t focus so much on strength.

I went for hps/sta when I was buying gear and over looked AC.<br/>\n<br/>\nOther than my wrist, back, finger, and waist what should I look to replace to gain the AC needed. I will be getting an ornate BP when I hit 55 and can do the quest.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat themes in LDoN do I need to work for those augs? On The Rathe very few people are doing LDoNs anymore because of OoW and now with the new expansion I doubt anyone will be running back to LDoN anytime soon leaving us warriors that need those augs high and dry.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for the help so far<br/>\nSebbonx<br/>\n01-30-2005, 08:25 AM<br/>\nThe anger augs are in EF, the 40hp augs in EC, the 10AC augs in BBM. You need em, press your guild to do LDoNs. The pet focus is in NRO, so is the best armor. The caster silk is in BBM. Good luck getting SRO, yekesha augs there, no one wanted to do SRO due to difficulty long ago either. I would rank em:<br/>\n<br/>\nBBM-easiest<br/>\nEF-easy<br/>\nEC-easy<br/>\nNRO-pita to break some rooms<br/>\nSRO-pain to break every room<br/>\nVenkmen<br/>\n01-30-2005, 11:58 AM<br/>\nSwitch out those bracers for something different. I would go with more of the Fierce Heraldic in those slots.<br/>\nBrabble<br/>\n01-31-2005, 05:20 AM<br/>\nI\'d agree that bracers are the spots I\'d improve first, and that cultural would be pretty good bang for the buck. Battlebronze band also a possibility if you have more cash.<br/>\n<br/>\nSince you\'re lvl 51, your gear is pretty good for that level. At some point you\'ll need to look at your haste, and deal with the LDoN/augment issue (which will take a good bit of time). On the other hand, you don\'t get a lot of points for winning LDoNs at 51, and you should be able to do your job for a good bit without LDoN augs. It\'s possible you\'d be better off just leveling for now and schedule the LDoNs for later, not only because of the low points you get for wins now, but because a relatively high percentage of gear with better AC on it than yours comes from raid targets/PoP zones where increased levels would help you tag along.

BF is a mainhand monster with massive proc aggro, but its power diminishes as its put in the offhand (everyone knows this). So will the 16/19 ratio with offhand proc-rate run circles around a 24/21 ratio in the offhand? My guess is that no, they\'d be closer than you think, and the aggro in despair is slightly more qualitative as its less dependant on a RNG which everyone knows has a bad tendency to bend you over backwards from time to time.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut, most people who have a BF mainhand that puppy, so this entire argument is moot. EoE + despair both with anger3 would be hot aggro. BF + EoE would be hot aggro. ToMAYto/ToMAHto ... methinks either will get the job done, but BF primary EoE secondary is probably significantly more aggro than EoE primary and Desp secondary.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would get a 125 yak aug and put it in despair, then Mainhand Desp in xp groups for the leet dps and while assisting on raids. DPS would be optimal and you would still be able to swap out BF for primary hand aggro as need calls.<br/>\nGunnar<br/>\n01-31-2005, 08:20 AM<br/>\nI like the bf. However, one of our tanks used an EOE mainhanded with a dps weapon and then epic offhanded for a long time. His aggro was better than you would think. The ratio and time snap proc worked well. When I backed off as MT to lead stuffs he was one of the 2 main tanks I rotated in for everything and he did well with that set up.<br/>\nEmiliaEQ<br/>\n01-31-2005, 11:37 AM<br/>\nRepeat after me : Insane proc mod do NOT a weapon make<br/>\n<br/>\nI do not have a BF, but i can comment about DBlade+Epic.<br/>\nAnd while they proc a LOT more than me, when my procs kick in they cant compete.<br/>\n<br/>\nNot to mention that at some time, even more aggro is not needed.<br/>\n<br/>\nGive it a try, see if it works.<br/>\nGunnar<br/>\n01-31-2005, 11:41 AM<br/>\nEpic vs dbotw in mainhand?

Your weaponry is otherwise relatively equal to the monks in terms of dps aggro though his are slightly higher, therefore the procs should theoretically kick you over the top.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnywho BF is better aggro mainhand for sure, just trying to see how you could squeeze the juice out of that combo to make it work in xp groups.<br/>\nWarhead42<br/>\n01-31-2005, 11:00 PM<br/>\nThere have been a few threads about Bloodfrenzy recently.<br/>\n<br/>\nI\'m with Frogger regarding Bloodfrenzy, it\'s absolutely phenomenal. In my eyes, there are only 3 weapons in the game (in the GAME, to emphasize) better than a mainhanded Bloodfrenzy. They are BBoB, Epic 2.0 and DBotW, in that order.<br/>\n<br/>\n25 AC on a 1 hander? You\'d be hard pressed to beat that.<br/>\n15% riposte mod? Is there anything better at all on a 1 hander?<br/>\n50% pure hate proc mod? You can\'t do better than that.<br/>\n<br/>\n16/20 isn\'t a great ratio compared to a lot of the new stuff coming out of high end GoD and OoW, but with the proc mod on EB, you simply can\'t make up the difference with weapon swings, even with a superior ratio weapon.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as having \"sufficient\" aggro in XP groups, try having group members kick their DPS output up a notch. If your group is doing max DPS and you don\'t need the Bloodfrenzy to hold aggro, then by all means bag it. I\'d bet that most of the time, though, the extra aggro produced by it is more useful (by allowing others to go full throttle) than the extra DPS from an arguably inferior aggro weapon.<br/>\nCimmar<br/>\n01-31-2005, 11:04 PM<br/>\ndespair was augged with yak .

My current weapon setup + symbol of the planesmasters is plenty of agro without using a 16/20 mainhand.<br/>\n<br/>\nI\'m not sure I\'m sold on how much tangible benefit you would get from the extra proc agro of a BF. It would depend solely on group makeup. The classes that would be able to outagro you with DPS generally can only do it in bursts. If the group wasn\'t lazy and was performing at maximum efficiency, those bursts might make up for the DPS hit you take by weilding a luclin era mainhand, but in my experience this isn\'t the case with most groups. In my opinion, the BF isn\'t the best choice in most single group situations.<br/>\n<br/>\n/me waits patiently for the 6 b0x0r r0x0r to notice this thread....<br/>\nYoda<br/>\n02-01-2005, 09:43 AM<br/>\n/me waits patiently for the 6 b0x0r r0x0r to notice this thread....<br/>\nwell, I am not even boxor but I will respond to you.<br/>\n<br/>\nI completly agree with you that if your group isn\'t putting you on the edge about aggro control then improving your aggro futher is a waste, thus as long as you can easily kept aggro over your particular group then the more dps you do the better it is.<br/>\nThe only sittuation that would force you to be on edge with aggro would be enchanter slowing on inc and nuking right after, while wiz nuk on inc. hopfully it doesn\'t happen.<br/>\nbardeil<br/>\n02-01-2005, 10:20 AM<br/>\nThe only sittuation that would force you to be on edge with aggro would be enchanter slowing on inc and nuking right after, while wiz nuk on inc. hopfully it doesn\'t happen.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThats what taunt is for.

The first being \"How much hate do I need?\" If an A3\'d or Ykesha Auged BoC isnt\' necessary, or is overkill for where you\'re fighting, or what you\'re fighting against, then the Bridgekeeper weapon is significantly better. 5AC, and 70hp, plus significantly increased damage is nothing to scoff at.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn other words, it\'s worth a try, if you can hold aggro significantly well with the weaker aggro weapon (Bridgekeeper sword), with what and where you\'re fighting, then the other benefits outweigh additional overkill aggro.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe way to break this down is:<br/>\n<br/>\nAggro:<br/>\nDefensive Stats:<br/>\nDPS:<br/>\n<br/>\nIt\'s not necessarily reasonable to discount the importance of DPS. <br/>\n<br/>\nFurthermore, there\'s another consideration to make for the less bright among us. Not all weapons need to be high aggro for you to use, or a \'waste of points\' if they\'re not related to aggro. I carry 27 weapons with me at all times for different purposes. I recently looted a Chaotic Black Scimitar, not because I needed it for hate, my current setup is fine for hate. Not because I \"needed it for DPS\", my current setup is fine for DPS, I could fairly easily swap out to Lodestar for DPS. There are times when I want a random 75 point heal/rune and nice DPS, and when soloing I want to be able to have the rune/heal, when auged with a veintappers\' stone, along with a Despair auged with a LDoN tap proc augment.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are times when I\'m not tanking on raids where I want to be more self sufficient and do good solid DPS. With AE taunt, it\'s completely stupid for warriors to ride the aggro teeter totter. You goal should normally be to be low on the hatelist, but on there nonetheless, then if it\'s your turn to tank, AE taunt, and while furious, swap out to high aggro weapons. Getting yourself plastered before it\'s your turn to tank because you were trying to be #2 on the hatelist is completely asinine, you\'re worthless at your bind point, particularly when AE taunt makes aggro switches effortless.<br/>\n<br/>\nHaving a few different sets of weapons makes you a better warrior. I am a better warrior than those who completely equip themselves with aggro and make themselves a danger to their raids when not tanking, or less effective because they use some old crapper to do DPS with. <br/>\n<br/>\nI am almost always at #4 or #5 so on my guild\'s DPS parses, because I don\'t let some board moron tell me that I\'m not DPS, or that I let the same assholes who are rolling against me in RSS for AC augments, or taking my Kelekdrix\'s Sandstone of Fortitudes have a weapon \"just because\".<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you make selections in gear simply on the premise that you\'re \"A tank, not DPS\", then that\'s precisely what you\'ll be. I on the other hand, am a warrior. I use every possible tool at my disposal to be the best i can be under any circumstance, and that includes being heavy DPS.<br/>\nBrutul<br/>\n01-31-2005, 02:28 PM<br/>\nWith AE taunt, it\'s completely stupid for warriors to ride the aggro teeter totter.

That said, I believe in getting even small upgrades whenever possible, through xp groups. So, to me, it doesn\'t matter to me how small of an upgrade it is, if it is an upgrade, and I can easily farm it with one group (and these shoulders seem to fit the bill), then I want them. For example, I am just one drop away from completing the Earring of the Brood quest, and all that is is a 1ac 65hp upgrade. So, if I can take the time to upgrade myself outside of raiding, then I will be a better tank on raids, and therefore, can help everyone else out on getting phat raid lewtz.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for what I am tanking, on raids, we are doing Emp/VT and PoP up to RZtW right now.

Only problem was actually finding the mob, was lucky it popped for us when it did. I\'d say under defensive he hits for 400-500 maybe (can\'t recall)? Give and take depending on your gear, but since it\'s slowable, it\'s definitely one groupable.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you\'re trying to get one for yourself, what we did was invis past the entrance mobs (horrific pathing and adds) and we headed to the graveyard area. From there, there is a tunnel that heads eastwards into an area that splits into a road going up to the castle, and one going into some kinda pit / dead end. We spawned Bloodwing that dropped it near the dead end area. Mind you, it spawned for us right after first repop, so I have no idea how long exactly it will take you to spawn him. Also, I am not sure if that is the ONLY place that he can spawn at.<br/>\n<br/>\nThings to know:<br/>\n1. Our 65 shaman complained that the gargoyle models had major resists to slows, even with Malo. These mobs hit hard too. So watch out for these.<br/>\n2. Cadaverous mobs = undead, so your invis won\'t work past these.<br/>\n3. Ranger pacify works.<br/>\n4. We didn\'t have a chanter, so not exactly sure if we could mezz the mobs. Only root CC was used hehe.<br/>\n5. Some mobs rampage in that zone, but it\'s not a big issue really.<br/>\n6. Up to where we fought, that is the ledge that has the entrance into the castle, only NAMED mobs will summon.

No procs at all (though there are spell casters, but I resisted everything they threw at me) The gargoyles as said above are extremely resistant little buggers, and are rather annoying to fight. I usually end up using stonewall on them so my druid partner doesnt have to waste so much mana. They also seem to have more hp than the others do as well. I have not had much (if at all) experience with mobs beyond the first \"field\" (the lame pathing part, where you zone in) makes me think of Velketor\'s though, with the crystalline gargoyles being the sleeper mobs that would kick your ass if you werent ready.

I know my gear isn’t bad, but I know it’s not fantastic either. I’ve seen loads of links from seemingly one-groupable mobs/trials and what I’m wondering is if I am a viable tank for all commonly available (read: no raid guild required) content up through OoW?<br/>\n<br/>\nMy equipment is up to date but for some weird reason it shows my AAs as much lower than they were when I retired (I was at 226 iirc and I assume my friend got a few more). I created a profile called “possible” on there as sort of a long-term plan for what might be doable (and I could be very wrong on a few). I simply do not have the time to do raiding full-time like I used to, so I’m stuck with 1 group stuff or pickup raids (not that any guild of interest on my server is recruiting anyway :p ). <br/>\n<br/>\nMostly I\'m thinking of upgrading my shoulders, 1 or both rings, legs, and perhaps picking up some good 1hrs (might aim at epic 1.5 anyway).<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks in advance.<br/>\nVenkmen<br/>\n02-01-2005, 11:41 AM<br/>\nThe things I can see are make sure to go after all the good augs that are out there with OoW.

Currently I am torn between Fang of Feratha or Despair and Stone Etched Mallet. I went to the Katta banker and parsed for a bit unhasted - turned out around 155 dps for both setups which kind of surprised me as I would have thought the Fang to be more DPS. I there any simple way to calculate weapon DPS when looking for future weapons and trying to decide if the weapon in question will be better DPS than ones current weapons?<br/>\n<br/>\nPerhaps Yoda\'s spreadsheet for agro can be twinked for this purpose?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks guys,<br/>\n<br/>\nAzahg<br/>\nYoda<br/>\n02-02-2005, 06:36 AM<br/>\nat first glance it can be calculated like this:<br/>\nDPS=avg_hit*#hit_per_min/60<br/>\nhit_per_min is already calculated in my spreadsheet (if you concider #hit = #swing)<br/>\navg_hit=DB+x*DM<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nthe problem is that x is dependent on you atk, skills, crit chance and crit domage, and mob\'s ac, lvl, ...<br/>\nMoreover this first glance doesn\'t take into account your accuracy (which depend on mods, level, skills, your position, mob\'s level, ...) nor the susceptibility of the mob agaisnt your weapon (see OoW trials) and the list goes on.<br/>\nthus a more accurate formula would be:<br/>\nDPS = mod1 * avg_hit * #swing_per_min / 60<br/>\n#swing_per_min : done<br/>\nmod1 = your accuracy<br/>\navg_hit = mod2 * ( mod3 * DB + x * mod4 * DM )<br/>\nmod2 = mob\'s susseptibility to your weapon type and some buff (champ?)<br/>\nmod3 = some disc bonus<br/>\nmod4 = some more disc bonus<br/>\nx = a bad to calculate thing that shows the mob\'s mittigation power versus you.<br/>\n<br/>\nso all in all, a basic idee of the kind of dps output can be made with the above formula with a fixed x that you have to chose, but it will never be directly transferable to infield dps. Since dps isn\'t our biggest role, you can just use whatever you can get that is decent.<br/>\n<br/>\nnote: a quick calculation gives (if we concider x as the only one variable and that mod3=mod4=1) that Despair/SEM should be worse dps than feratha for x&gt;1.558, which seems to low, so my calculation should be complete wrong.<br/>\napolyon<br/>\n02-02-2005, 08:29 AM<br/>\nMy gut tells me FoFeratha might be stronger than desp + SEM.

Like apolyon says my gut feeling would be that Feratha would be better DPS but I guess I can\'t argue with half hour EQ companion parses on Katta banker.<br/>\n<br/>\nBrutal - You are right, parsing will always be more accurate than calculators but Yoda math takes a few seconds (for him anyways) and usally gives a pretty good estimate of a weapon comparison.

As a warrior you innately crit moer than any other class, and with crits capped eclipse all others in critical hit rate. Adding a 30% bonus to crit damage was simply huge. On fights where i get my average number of crits, i do about 20-30 more dps than on fights where in only get 1 or 2 (which is very rare). Occasionally i\'ll crit what seems like every 2nd or 3rd swing of my weapons, and on fights like that it\'s not at all uncommon for me to make the rangers/rogues in my group who are parsing shit bricks.<br/>\n<br/>\nBest to date is 277 with just ench haste and 323 with full buffs (no disc). Really does make a noticable difference in xp group situations, though it is kind of depressing to group with rangers/casters (and yes even rogues occasionally) who habitually put out less dps than i do. Good for me ... bad for the group.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat said, you reallly should finish off defensives before offensives. I would buy slippery attacks 5 and finish off Weapon affinity at least before workin offensives.<br/>\n<br/>\nPS- Sinister strikes is an excellent pure dps aa i\'d put your 2hander onthe backburner for lower aggro dps. After you get epic 1.5 your DW combo should be both more dps and more aggro by a ton, and be far more tank friendly with Slippury attacks.<br/>\nYoda<br/>\n02-04-2005, 08:13 AM<br/>\nabout next dps AA: flurry 9 then double ripost then crits. btw, if you choose 2Her, finish PB inside flurry. (they all gives some dps, in that order, but they gives aggro too <E>:)</E>) they might not be the best dps but they are the only ones to gives aggro too.<br/>\n<br/>\nabout my math: they don\'t estimate dps since, as I said, it\'s too complicated since there is too much variables. but you can look at what would change during the same fight if you just change your weapon.<br/>\n<br/>\ntake another look at the formula:<br/>\nDPS = mod1 * avg_hit * #swing_per_min / 60<br/>\n#swing_per_min : done<br/>\nmod1 = your accuracy<br/>\navg_hit = mod2 * ( mod3 * DB + x * mod4 * DM )<br/>\nmod2 = mob\'s susseptibility to your weapon type and some buff (champ?)<br/>\nmod3 = some disc bonus<br/>\nmod4 = some more disc bonus<br/>\nx = a bad to calculate thing that shows the mob\'s mittigation power versus you.<br/>\n<br/>\nso lets says you do DPS1 with your weapon_01 and DPS2 with your weapon_02, you don\'t know how to calculate DPS1 and DPS2 but you know what are their formula.<br/>\nmake the ratio DPS1/DPS2, some simplification will arise:<br/>\n* lets assume on top of it that you don\'t have any strikethrough hability that let you hit the mob even when he dodge.<br/>\n* lets suppose that you are fighting from the back of the mob (thus the mob won\'t ripost you nor will you ripost to the mob, thus the total number of swings you do on a given period of time if perfectly calculable).<br/>\n* you can concider that you have the same skill level on in the two weapon type, thus mod1 is constant within theese to formula (ie you have the same accuracy with weapon_01 and weapon_02), thus you can simplify them from the ratio.<br/>\n* we assume that you didn\'t change your buff and such (worn atk,...) so that mod2 is another constant (you face a mob without weakness/resist difference between the two weapon); you can remove mod2 from the ratio.<br/>\n* to compare efficiently to weapons\' dps you chouldn\'t use a disc on one and none (or a diffrent one) with the other. Thus we will take mod3=mod4=1; but if you want to compare fellstrike\'s dps them mod3=5 and mod4=2.<br/>\n<br/>\nthus the ratio is, under all the above conditions, r=(DB1+x*DM1)*SWpm1/(DB2+x*DM2)*SWpm2<br/>\nnumerous parses have given us the approximated number of swings per round (see my spreadsheet for numerical values) at a given accuracy thus SWpm is calculable.<br/>\nthe only unknown value that remains is \'x\' but we know it\'s a real bounded betwen 1 and 20 (if you concider that we won\'t allways crit/cripple) that expresses your average hit power (x=1 meams you hit allways for mins, x=20 means you hit allways for max without any crit/cripple, x=5.68 means that all your normal/crit/crip hit had the same dps output as a constant hit value of DB+5.68*DM).<br/>\nsince x is bounded, the ratio of the two weapons is bounded too (because the ratio formula is continuous on the domain of x).<br/>\nsince the ratio is the division of two linear (affine actually) equation, the ratio is either constant (paralell lines) or as a minimum value (which is one obviously) and increase as we get farer from the crossing point.<br/>\nSO, lets calculate this particular x value (lets call it x0) that makes the ratio equal to one.<br/>\nin your case, I got x0=-0.8 thus you will never see your two weapon puting out the same dps (since x is between 1 and 20), thus the results (which is better dps the the other?) will be always true for you. From this point, you just calculate the extremum value of the ratio (which are for x=1 and x=20 obviously) and you get 0.5% and 1.7% (out of memory) for you. thus we have the result that one of the two weapon is at best 2% (rounding far up) better dps than the other, we just have to check which has the min domage (DM+DB) and you know which is it.<br/>\nif x0 is between 1 and 20 then it means that you could have different results depending on the mob you are facing or the buff/ debuff you have on you (that will move x between 1 and 20). again you calculate the max difference between the two weapon (r(x=1) and r(x=20)) and the min hit of both. upon the value of x, you will make your chose, inndeed, in a normal fight we have x between 4 and 6 (general values) thus if x0=1.9 or 16 you can guess which is actually better for you because even if theoritically x is betwen 1 and 20, in reallity the average it never goes too far from 5 (except some sittuationnal cases).<br/>\nOK, I explained how to compare weapons dps without knowing their dps, but my explaination was for two weapon, and you asked for a DW combo versus a 2Her... well, actually you have to calculate the virtual 2Her that is equivalent of your DW, which is very simple: you just sum the dps formulas of the two (beware, the offhander has a different swing-per-round number). You can make the hypothesys that x is the same between the mainhand and the offhand and you get the formulla for a virtual single weapon that you can compare (with the ratio) to another one.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHave fun,<br/>\nYoda.<br/>\nghazad<br/>\n02-07-2005, 07:14 AM<br/>\nThanks for taking the time Yoda, much appreciated - I understand it better now even though I am still a bit confused.

Is that Damage Minimum or min_hit from your other posts= DB+DI? or is it Damage Mean, and if so how would it be calculated? or is it the same as DI which has been calculated as: Weapon_Damage/10?

I\'m glad I asked first. This makes explanation makes sense. These variables you were mentioning (str, dex, etc) make actual prediction of dps unreliable, I guess I was just seeing if I could come up with a general comparison of weapons assuming that all other variables remained equal (i.e. If the same character switched from one specific weapon to another, how much difference would there be in dps output). The end result probably wouldn\'t be a lot more useful than just looking at the dmg/dly ratio we do on a regular basis. It was more curiosity than anything.

I have several questions about the set up I should use for this combination. First off, I three box for most of my experience (so aggro is a non-issue here) and want to make sure I have my theoretical DPS calcs correct. I have always heard a good rule of thumb is to use the formulae:<br/>\n<br/>\nMain hand (MH): [(dam x 2) + DB] / dly<br/>\nOff Hand (OH): (dam x 2) / dly<br/>\nOverall damage = MH + OH<br/>\n<br/>\nUsing these formula we get:<br/>\n<br/>\nJoS in MH: [(30 x 2) + 15] / 25 = 3.0<br/>\nEoE in OH: (20 x 2) / 20 = 2.0<br/>\nJoS MH + EoE OH = 5.0<br/>\n<br/>\nEoE in MH: [(20 x 2) + 15] / 20 = 2.75<br/>\nJoS in OH: (30 x 2) / 25 = 2.4<br/>\nEoE MH + JoS OH = 5.15<br/>\n<br/>\nSo looking at these numbers, I \'should\' do better damage overall with EoE MH and JoS OH. Is this the case in practice assuming only Ferocity 3 as AA\'s? Is it the case with Fero3/ambi/SS? I know it depends on the mob...I do most of my exp at C2 in fire.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, my second major question: Which would be better as the main hander for aggro on a raid (assuming the same aug in both...A3 or Yak, I have not decided on which of these either)? I dug this up from one of the threads in my search on these topics (from Yoda I think):<br/>\n<br/>\n\"EoE is better aggro than JoS (but not that much). But JoS\'s hate is much more tight to its DPS.<br/>\nThus my suggestion would be do equipe EoE main when you plan to make a long fight (tipically as a Raid MT) and to eqquipe JoS main when you face mob with few HP (tipically exp group). Like this you will built up over time the more aggro when EoE is mainhanded, and you will get a faster early aggro to let the slow land sooner, etc ... when JoS is mainhanded.\"<br/>\n<br/>\nReading this, EoE mainhand would be better...is that still true with current thoughts?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks a ton for any imput!<br/>\nYoda<br/>\n02-02-2005, 09:23 AM<br/>\nI dug this up from one of the threads in my search on these topics (from Yoda I think):<br/>\n<br/>\n\"EoE is better aggro than JoS (but not that much).

Also, the stun on the sword as mentioned before sticks on 65\'s, where as the hammer i believe stops around 55ish. I found the sword to be better agro, but this was some time ago. I\'d imagine if they both have a2+ augs agro should be almost the same.<br/>\nFrig Coldheart<br/>\n02-02-2005, 10:38 PM<br/>\nI would say you just had a run of bad luck.

To the best of my knowledge this perception comes from a study done where the hate generated by the Paladin\'s line of stuns was determained to be worth 450 hate points. <br/>\nIt was then stated that: we can assume all stuns generate the same amount of hate. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt is this assumction that I have a problem with. <br/>\nAs I remember the Paladin line of stun spells were added with the PoP expanction, for the expressed purpose of giving Palies a way to generate aggro like SK and at that time warriors. Pre PoP Paladins had a hard time getting groups and one of the reasons was their inability to hold aggro. <br/>\n<br/>\nIs it logica to assume that a lvl 20 wiz spell (Force Shock) would generate as much aggro as a spell thats only purpose is to give paladins a way of generating aggro? I dont\' think so. <br/>\n<br/>\nFurthermore there are any number of caster stun spell that are cast often but don\'t result in the caster getting aggro like a paladin. This is easy to see when fighting mobs that gate. While the mob is casting gate all the caster who can cast stun spells do. However if the mob completes the gate and after healing heads back to the pary it still has the tank on top of his hate list. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOn this and other boards I\'ve read statments that also suggest that all stuns are not equil.<br/>\nFor example <br/>\n1. Aggro seems better with the SotBS as primary than the CHoS.<br/>\nI agree that there is a slight dps advantage to this configuration. However I don\'t think it would be noticable. So the logica conclusion is Planar Strike &gt; Force Shock for hate, and since FS has a bigger dd it must follow that the stun of PS &gt; the stun of FS for the amount of hate generated.<br/>\n<br/>\n2. For aggro the GSoT &gt; Droga weapons. <br/>\nHow is it that one stun proc with no dd can out aggro two stun procs that both have dd? Now some might suggest that the GSoT has more dps. But not even someone as crazy as me would suggest that there is enough dps differance to account for the differance in hate generated. <br/>\n<br/>\n3. I can tell no differance between the amount of hate generated when I use the JA and the CHoS as my primary weapon. <br/>\nNow without the above statments one might be tempted to dismiss this and other JA/CHoS generate about the same amount of aggro statments as the delusions of a tormented mind. <br/>\n<br/>\n4. The Force Shock proc dosen\'t seem to generate as much hate as a2. <br/>\nIf the Force Shock proc was 450 hate + whatever for the dd then it should be more aggro than the a2. And we know that the Paladin stuns are &gt; a2.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt seems to me that Logic, spell to spell compairson (caster stuns vs paladin stuns), and compairisons of different stun procs on weapons, do not support the assumction that all stun generate the same amount of hate. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt seems that <br/>\nPlaner Stun (GSoT proc I mean) &gt; Planer Strike &gt; Force Shock.<br/>\napolyon<br/>\n02-03-2005, 07:53 AM<br/>\nYou\'re getting way ahead of yourself on a lot of things with a lot of funky conclusions based on evidence from peoples\' opinions<br/>\n<br/>\n1. I\'m pretty sure paladins have had the stun line of spells for as long as the clerics have had the stun line of spells.<br/>\n<br/>\n2. All proc stuns (minus fleshbiter) appear to have the same aggro value. Force shock is arguably stronger than planar strike simply and only because the dd value is stronger.<br/>\n<br/>\n3. Nowhere is it written in stone that SoTBS is a better primary aggro weapon than CHoS. This is only one man\'s opinion (mine) and is only due to the fact that i found the dps aggro to counterbalance the very very small difference in proc aggo.<br/>\n<br/>\n4. SoTBS only has the assumed advantage mainhand (if said advantage even exists).<br/>\n<br/>\n5. GSoT is comparable aggro to the droga combo. It has more dps aggro but less proc aggro. As soon as you start fiddiling with aggro augs the GSoT is left behind in the dust.<br/>\n<br/>\n6. Force strike is more aggro than anger2. Anger2 is 400ish hate. Anger3 is 600ish hate. Stun falls somewhere btw the two, and 450 is a convenient number to use.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn all seriousness the stuns are practically equal, but if i had to pick an order it would be the exact opposite of what you chose.<br/>\n<br/>\nForce strike &gt; Planar strike &gt; Planar stun<br/>\n179dd &gt; 75dd &gt; 0 dd<br/>\n<br/>\nBob thinks carrots taste better than peas. Bob thinks onions taste good too (and better than peas as well), and he doesnt get diahrehea (spelling sucks) as often eating them as he does with carrots. Therefore it stands to reason that onions are the best vegetables followed by carrots then peas. This was bob\'s experience and opinion, and is not indicative of some greater truth.<br/>\n<br/>\nNone of the premises in the argument for proc stuns having different values hold water and are largely based on people\'s gut feelings. If you wanted to argue this, the weapon you should have used is the fleshbiter, because it seems to violate all the existing assumed rules as to proc hate. As it stands however, these stuns seem pretty similar, and i would pick force strike as the strongest of the 3.<br/>\nBrabble<br/>\n02-03-2005, 08:04 AM<br/>\nI too would be interested in a proof of the relative aggro of different stuns.<br/>\n<br/>\nbut I would say that the bit about GSoT generating more hate than the droga combo is certainly not a universally agree-upon proposition, and in particular when you read \"get a GSoT\" in these forums there might be a number of non-stun elements being considered by the person giving the advice.<br/>\nfor example, a lvl 56 warrior with no offensive AAs and say 130 dex is not going to be generating the same percentage of hate from his procs as a lvl 65 war with WA 5 and maxxed dex. For the lvl 56 guy, the potential/melee damage aggro and his incite line is going to be a higher percentage and a more reliable part of his aggro; the GSoT looks relatively good under those conditions. But especially if you have two aggro augments, appropriate AAs, and maxxed dex, the GSoT has, I think, less max potential.<br/>\nAt any rate, Yoda\'s calculations appear to suggest that the GSoT is better aggro than the droga pair, but yoda would probably also agree that for the moment his formulas are works in progress--food for thought rather than proof.<br/>\nApolyon has argument vigorously in favor of the GSoT, though other warriors have argued on the opposite side; see this:<br/>\n<URL url=\"http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?t=7621&amp;highlight=shared\"><LINK_TEXT text=\"http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/sh ... ght=shared\">http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?t=7621&amp;highlight=shared</LINK_TEXT></URL><br/>\n<br/>\nPeople agree that the GSoT is decent aggro when you can equip it.<br/>\nPeople agree that the GSoT is a lot cheaper than the droga pair.<br/>\nPeople do not all agree that the GSoT is better aggro than the droga pair.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt the moment, I\'ve got an untwinked 57 war I sometimes play. he\'s using a GSoT, and it seems to work well enough. He often groups with a same-level ranger who has max dex and runs a flintforged cudgel mainhand and a jagged antiquity offhand. My warrior\'s dex unbuffed is 140ish, so usually the ranger is max dex and I\'m not. He does not have to back off the mobs for me to hold aggro--I know, because I ask. He can take aggro early if he chain procs, but I don\'t doubt that would be true no matter what I was using, since in isolated instances RNG&gt; all.<br/>\nBut my warrior is not running the GSoT because he thinks it\'s the best aggro in the game, heh. It\'s because he\'s broke and finishing smithing his cultural armor and saving copper for better haste. If the GSoT didn\'t work, I\'d dump it. I haven\'t dumped it because it works for now, but that doesn\'t mean I think it\'s better than the droga pair.<br/>\napolyon<br/>\n02-03-2005, 08:11 AM<br/>\nIf more peopl had ever agreed with me i\'d be more inclined to believe it\'s closer to \"fact\", but the simple point that there have been such arguments over it in the past should tell you that it\'s just one bloke\'s opinion <E>:D</E><br/>\nYoda<br/>\n02-03-2005, 09:41 AM<br/>\nI feel bad for Bob ...<br/>\n<br/>\nBTW, I second all what Appolon and Brable said.<br/>\nRigeld<br/>\n02-03-2005, 10:51 AM<br/>\nAshlanne told the pallies on the EQLive boards that all pally stuns anyway generated the same hate. <br/>\n<br/>\nI checked into this again on this issue.

Where warriors move from the droga combo to GSoT when having problems holding aggro. So the comparision is in the same group vs the same mobs and the finding indacate that the GSoT had better aggro. <br/>\n<br/>\nGSoT is very decent aggro. Dual weilding 2 stun weapons, such as CHoS and SotB, is better aggro due to more procs. <br/>\n<br/>\nLike the the above statment those who favor the Drago combo do so on theroy. I don\'t think I\"ve ever seen a statment that said I couldn\'t hold aggro with the GSoT and had to switch to the Droga combo. <br/>\n<br/>\nFor me statments like I noticed move aggro when switching to the GSoT from the droga combo have more weight than I think the Droga Combo is better. <br/>\n<br/>\n5. GSoT is comparable aggro to the droga combo. It has more dps aggro but less proc aggro. As soon as you start fiddiling with aggro augs the GSoT is left behind in the dust. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis seems reasionable to me. But then no one should be surprized that two a3\'s give more aggro than one a3. Once you start fiddiling with aggro augs you are no longer conpairing Force Shock to Planar Strike. <br/>\nAnd since it is accepted that two a3 are stronger than one, shouldn\'t two stun procs be stronger than one? (assuming they generate the same amount of hate)?<br/>\n<br/>\nGreatstaff of thunder, and even warmarshalls staff is VERY close to the same DPS as droga weapons. <br/>\nMy pares show GSoT and the Droga combo to be very close in dps. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSo if the dps is about the same, two procs of the same str should generate more aggro. And the differance should be as easy to see as the differance of two a3\'s vs. one a3. <br/>\n<br/>\nAshlanne told the pallies on the EQLive boards that all pally stuns anyway generated the same hate. <br/>\nThe fact that all paladin stuns generate the same hate isn\'t the same thing as all stun generate the same hate. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as other classes stunning and not getting agro; If youre building hate for the entire fight, and all of a sudden people start stunning at 20%, why would stuns suddenly override your agro? <br/>\n<br/>\nAt any point of a fight a Paladin can normally take aggro by casting one stun. Ah but you say the Paladin has been generating hate through out the fight. So have the other member of the crew. Healers heal and caster cast dd. Seems to me one of the things us warriors have to work hardest at is staying ahead of the casters on the hate list. This being the case a quick 450 or 900 worth of hate shold put them well ahead of us. <br/>\n<br/>\n1. I\'m pretty sure paladins have had the stun line of spells for as long as the clerics have had the stun line of spells. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe Paladins stun spells are sold in PoK not the home towns of Pallies.<br/>\n<br/>\nthe very very small difference in proc aggo. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf all stun procs generate the same amount of aggro this very small difference in proc aggro would be 2(276) dd aggro + 360 from the extra .8 of stun. Easly the equilevent of an a2 or more if you asks me.<br/>\n<br/>\nNone of the premises in the argument for proc stuns having different values hold water and are largely based on people\'s gut feelings. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis is true enough. Statments like i was using the Droga combo and was having problems holding aggro so i tried the GSoT and held aggro are just people\'s gut.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut then what is the belife that all procs generate the same amount of aggro based on?<br/>\nSomeone once said \"We can ASSUME that all stuns generate the same amount of hate\"<br/>\nNow there is some rock hard evidance....<br/>\nRigeld<br/>\n02-03-2005, 01:20 PM<br/>\nThe 450 hate from a stun comes from tests using a paladin stun. So if you accept that number, then you accept the fact that a paladins stun is equal to a procced stun.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Paladin only line of stuns was added with PoP; but they have had access to the shared cleric line since the beginning.<br/>\n<br/>\nObviously, if the Tank stops generating agro and the rest of the group continues to, then yes, after the mob gates and comes back he will (more than likely) head for a caster. Since, however, the Tank is STILL generating hate, he will STILL be above the other people in the group on the mobs hatelist.<br/>\nArathena<br/>\n02-03-2005, 01:46 PM<br/>\nThe Paladins stun spells are sold in PoK not the home towns of Pallies.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nA brief history of hybrid spell vendors and the paladin stun line. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn the Beginning, there were hybrids. Now, these quasi-mythological beasts, and at the time, there were only 3 of them, got the joy of being able to melee quasi-effectively, as well as cast spells... At a penalty of casting as a caster 9 levels lower(complete with mana pool penalty), and at a double, and in some cases, even triple, mana cost penalty. Now, every single spell that a hybrid got in the old days, through orginal EQ and Kunark, was purchasable, because hybrids weren\'t allowed to research spells. Every single spell was ALSO castable by one of the parent classes. Therefore, the only time a home city for a hybrid required special hybrid vendors was when that city did not also support the parent caster, which occured only in Grobb and Oggok. Therefore, the paladin castable stuns were always available at the cleric guild. Stun, Divine Might, and Force can all be purchased in the following original world cities: Freeport, Qeynos, Neriak, Kaladim, Felwithe, Ak\'anon, Erudin and Riverhell. They can also now be purchased in Paineel, Gukta, Seru, Katta Castellum, and PoK, and the highest level of them can be purchased in Firiona Vie. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn The Beginning, as well, Paladins only had two stuns - Stun and, if I recall the order correctly, Force. In Kunark, they were given Divine Might in the fifties. This resulted in high level paladins having excellent anti-caster abilities, as well as \'reasonable\' aggro, while a paladin that was too low to cast Stun, a level 30? 39? spell for them, was pretty screwed. Velious started the seperation of hybrid and parent caster spell lines, giving a pattern by which this could be addressed. Therefore, in the Luclin expansion, paladins were given Cease and Desist at levels 9 and 15, respectively. As expansion spell, these spells, were, of course, only purchasable in the expansion itself, and can still be bought in Shadow Haven, Seru, and Katta Castellum. Out of courtsey, the grand majority of previous spells were placed the PoK library, which is very, very slightly more accessible than Shadow Haven - But these spells should not be confused for PoP era spells. <br/>\n<br/>\nStunning has always been an integral part of the higher level paladin, since day one, however, the stun line itself, as well as casting aggro, has evolved greatly over the years. It is true that Paladin stuns really began to take off from their initial weakness during the PoP era, however, the new applications of these spells rested in the new power of the mobs and extremely quick player kill rate giving an enormous advantage to the tank that could keep aggro and turn off a significant portion of the mob\'s DPS in one spell, not new magic aggro spells. When SoE wants to give aggro specific spells, they give straight up hate. Warriors have a pure hate line, SKs have a pure hate line, and the Paladin has not yet required a pure hate line. <br/>\n<br/>\nNow, chances are, stun is a static hate value, unless there\'s the addition of modified hate, such as in Anger, though this value may change class to class, as it\'s comparatively easy to say stun = 400 hate, Wizard spell hate modifier = 0.8, cleric spell hate modifier = 0.8, warrior spell hate modifier = 1, Paladin spell hate mod = 2.0, as opposed to having seperate hate numbers for each and every stun/class combo, etc. It makes efficient coding sense, with the apparent exception of Static Blow - that kind of efficency is just good sense when you\'re coding something like EQ. I\'ll check Static Blow in Lucy for the same modifier as Terror of Discord when I get home: There may be \'invisible\' aggro on it, as there was a significant revamp of the spell database structure with the GoD expansion, possibly to allow non-\'pure hate\' modifiers, as well as the dozen other kinds of functionality that were added.<br/>\nYoda<br/>\n02-03-2005, 01:50 PM<br/>\nbrief ?<br/>\nArathena<br/>\n02-03-2005, 02:44 PM<br/>\n.. I coulda written more. <E>:)</E><br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, while it\'s not the same modifier as on Terror / Dread Gaze / Cyclone Blade, Fleshbiter has an Unknown field set that\'s not set on any of the other stuns: I\'m betting that static shock, if you bothered, would parse out to around 1350 hate, if Unknown150 and Unknown161 are various forms of Hate, as I suspect them to be.<br/>\nYoda<br/>\n02-03-2005, 03:10 PM<br/>\nit wasn\'t brief but it was perfect. My momeries were mixing a bit, I forgot all the changes that each expension brought, and you made it clear again, thanks.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd about lucy, yes, it would be interesting to check all the spells upon theese two fields (unknown 150 &amp; 161) but lucy doesn\'t allows this and EQitems doesn\'t support well spells...<br/>\nTinman<br/>\n02-05-2005, 03:39 AM<br/>\nThe 450 hate from a stun comes from tests using a paladin stun. So if you accept that number, then you accept the fact that a paladins stun is equal to a procced stun. <br/>\n<br/>\nI accept the fact that the hate value of a paladin stun was determained by comparing it to a SK spell with know hate value.... but I\'m confused as to how this froces my acceptance of the assumction that a paladin\'s stun is equal to a prcess stun.<br/>\n<br/>\nit\'s comparatively easy to say stun = 400 hate, <br/>\nas opposed to having seperate hate numbers for each and every stun/class combo, etc. It makes efficient coding sense, <br/>\n<br/>\nI\'m not sure I completly understand what is being agured here. It seems to me they are saying it is easier and more efficent coding to have a set hate value for stun, instead of a number of different hate values for different stuns.<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst and formost the coding or programing expresses the desires of the game desingers. Therefore the question isn\'t so much what is easier but what is the intent of the desingers.<br/>\n<br/>\nSecond Spells and procs more likly than not are subrutines. It is a very simple matter to change a few lines of a standard subrutein. For example look at all the different dd spells there are in the game. Each with different amounts of damage done and mana used. Since we have an example of a number of different subrutiens for dd, we can assume that should the desingers want different amounts of hate for different stuns it would be easy enough to write the code to reflect their desires. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs stated earlier I\'ve seen at least three different post where a person says I was using the Droga combo and was having problems holding aggro. I then switched to the GSoT and was able to hold aggro much better. Now this observation has been explaned in a couple of different ways:<br/>\n<br/>\n1. The better aggro is do to the GSoT having better dps.<br/>\nAll the evidance suggest that there is almost no dps differance between the two set ups. Also if all stuns generate 450 hate then the dps has to be large enough to over come 0.8 (stun) + over 300hp of dd, or about the same as an additional stun proc. Noone has suggested that there is that much differance in the dps. Therefor we can reject this explanation.<br/>\n<br/>\n2. The folks who clame to notice a better dps are mistaken. They think they are seeing better aggro control but in reality they are not. After all we know how unreliable eyewitnesses are or can be. <br/>\nThe problem with this agrument is that a number of different eyewitnesses are claming to see the same exact thing. Futhermore there are no eyewitnesses that say I was using the GSoT and having problems holding aggro and switched to the Droga combo and hand noticable better aggro control. <br/>\nFinally how is it that the ability to hold aggro between the two is close enough for there to be any confusion? After all the Droga combo should have about 450 more hate from procs. Since the dps is nearly the same the amount of procless aggro should be about the same. Also the Droga combo should have fewer fights with one or no procs and thus should provide better aggro. If the hate value of the two different stuns are equil then the Droga combo should be noticable better. <br/>\n<br/>\nDespite the above and similuar in game observation that bring the all stuns generate the same amount of hate assumction into quesiton, the vast majority of warriors hold fast to the all stuns are equil dogma. <br/>\nAfter all this assumction has long been held and if it were wrong surely we would of know it by now. Surly so many couldn\'t be wrong for so long.<br/>\nAnd most say since there is no evidance to support your assumction Tinman, we reject your aserction that Planer Strik &gt; Force Shock. <br/>\n<br/>\nAlthough it maybe inpossable to prove that Planer &gt; Force Shock, it is very easy to test the all stuns have the same aggro theroy. <br/>\n<br/>\nHow you say?<br/>\nSimple have a Paladin cast stun and a wiz cast Force Shock. If all stuns have the same aggro then Force Shock should out aggro the paladin\'s stun. <br/>\n<br/>\nOn every mob regardless of who cast first or who stood where Palidan Stun &gt; Force Shock for aggro. <br/>\n<br/>\nNow I\'m sure that there will be a number of complicated aggruments put forth to explain how the above isn\'t prof that different stuns have differnt hate values.<br/>\nBut while reading these arguemnts remember Acuman (sp) Razor. An accepted sincetific prinsable that states the most simple explanation is the most likly explanation. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd the most simple explanation for the observations that Paladian Stun &gt; Force Shock for aggro, and the GSoT &gt; Droga Combo for aggro is different values for different stuns.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe different stuns have different aggro theroy explanes both the observations. The all stuns have the same aggro theroy is in disagreement with both observations.</r>','3a884723edaff685aa233cf6f8243827',0,'','iexp639a',1,0,'',0,0,0,1,0,'',0),(18,18,36,2,0,'50.25.122.79',1506259910,0,1,1,1,1,'','1.5+BRBS vs. BoW?','<r>Kogur<br/>\n02-03-2005, 08:18 AM<br/>\nHey guys,<br/>\n<br/>\nI\'m \"fairly sure\" I know which is superior, but I\'m not certain which would be better for general dps.<br/>\n<br/>\nChampion\'s Sword of Eternal Power (Augmented)<br/>\nSkill: 1H Slashing Atk Delay: 26<br/>\nDMG: 28 AC: 45<br/>\nSTR: +20 DEX: +20 STA: +30 CHA: +25 <br/>\nHP: +235 ENDUR: +190 SV DISEASE: +20 SV COLD: +20 <br/>\nSV MAGIC: +25 <br/>\nShielding: +3% <br/>\nEffect: Force of Ykesha (Combat)<br/>\nEffect: Force of Ykesha (Combat)<br/>\nSlot 1, type 4: Slimestone Fragment of Dread<br/>\nSlot 2, type 8: Radiant Fragment of Dread<br/>\n<br/>\nand <br/>\n<br/>\nBone-Rending Battle Sword (Augmented)<br/>\nSkill: 1H Slashing Atk Delay: 20<br/>\nDMG: 24 AC: 25<br/>\nDEX: +30 STA: +30 AGI: +30 HP: +210 <br/>\nMANA: +195 ENDUR: +195 SV DISEASE: +25 SV COLD: +25 <br/>\nSV POISON: +30<br/>\nEffect: Chaotic Strike I (Combat)<br/>\nEffect: Strike of Ykesha (Combat)<br/>\nSlot 1, type 8: Radiant Slimestone of Shock <br/>\n<br/>\nOR<br/>\n<br/>\nBlade of War (Augmented)<br/>\nMAGIC ITEM LORE ITEM NO DROP <br/>\nSlot: PRIMARY <br/>\nSkill: 2H Slashing Atk Delay: 32<br/>\nDMG: 48 AC: 50<br/>\nSTR: +30 STA: +30 WIS: +15 INT: +15 <br/>\nAGI: +30 HP: +175 MANA: +175 ENDUR: +175 <br/>\nSV FIRE: +18 SV DISEASE: +18 SV COLD: +18 <br/>\nEffect: Enraging Blow (Combat)<br/>\nEffect: Vampire Kiss (Combat)<br/>\nSlot 1, type 4: Veintapper\'s Stone<br/>\n<br/>\nI think that the dual wield combo (I have ALL offensive AA\'s minus double riposte) is better on both aggro and dps...just want a second/third opinion.<br/>\nKleth<br/>\n02-03-2005, 08:19 AM<br/>\nI\'d take the dual weild if only for near double stats you gain from it, the BRBS is a great weapon and with Epic you should have 0 problem holding agro from all but the fastest debuffs/overnukes.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I do think it will out dps the BoW but I havn\'t done any numbers.<br/>\napolyon<br/>\n02-03-2005, 08:33 AM<br/>\nLets just put it this way ... epic 1.5 and trident of pyrilen i average 220 dps from behind the mob with spikes up to 277 (personal best with just chanter haste) and 200-210ish dps from in front of the mob (not counting damage shield) with chanter haste and all offensives minus some OoW flurry and strikethrough.<br/>\n<br/>\nBoWar averages btw 170ish-200 max offensive.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat particular Duel wield combo i\'m sure would net me an average of 250+ dps at all times with sword in the primary.

Took me 16 hours in one of the camps to get one drop. The others were somewhat closer to an hour to 3 hours. All in all its a good quest and a great earring, but unless you have seru\'s head already, its not worth it imo.<br/>\nSarcazzm<br/>\n02-05-2005, 09:25 PM<br/>\nI found the earring of glowing rage for like 15k one morning in bazaar, next morning it was like 65k. id say for the price i found its worth it. got the warclasp on rot, ran naked during another corpse run, without invis or sow, all the way to mpg and got a CoH to camp hehe.<br/>\n<br/>\nif you can xp for a hooked claw+warclasp earring i\'d say that should be a good setup to last you a while. the glowing ear rocks but is just plain overpriced.<br/>\nKebast<br/>\n02-05-2005, 09:51 PM<br/>\nYeah, prices for the Glowing earring are simular on my server...saw one for 20k and two others were for sell at 60k...The one for 20k has been sitting there for several days though at that <E>:)</E>. I try to stay away from long camp quests for Greagor since he\'s really an alt and at least 2/3 of my time is spent on Kebast. That said, I think the Fierce Hook is my best option atm if I can\'t find the Warclasp rotting. I have been looking for a leg upgrade as well and had forgot about the GoD drops. I might give that a try sometime, thanks for the suggestions.<br/>\nNiclet<br/>\n02-06-2005, 11:05 AM<br/>\nI use this (see post for details):<br/>\n<br/>\nDeathborn Hoop Details (<URL url=\"http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?zone=270&amp;mid=109942896824948\"><LINK_TEXT text=\"http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/searc ... 2896824948\">http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?zone=270&amp;mid=109942896824948</LINK_TEXT></URL>) <br/>\n<br/>\nI have the Warclasp in the other ear.</r>','4f44af38dd5796261977faec4196c378',0,'','250kmt0r',1,0,'',0,0,0,1,0,'',0),(22,22,36,2,0,'50.25.122.79',1506260119,0,1,1,1,1,'','how does a scepter of destruction compare to other aggro weaps','<t>Soulcoughing<br/>\n02-05-2005, 04:28 AM<br/>\ngot one at a decent price today just wondering how it compare to boc or any other buyable one. Not into raiding or anything to cool at 60 atm so just curious if its something to stick with.

Thanks for input.<br/>\nBattleblade<br/>\n02-05-2005, 08:53 AM<br/>\nAfaik, not much has happened in dropable/attunable aggro weapons. There is Bygone Butcher\'s Cleaver but that\'s about it.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt level 60, Sword of the Bloodsworn/Copper Hammer of Striking is probably near the top.<br/>\n<br/>\nBest buyable is probably Bygone Butcher\'s Cleaver/BoC and it is better than SotBS/CHoS.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I were at that level and determined to do better, I\'d get some high-level friends to go to PoI and let you loot a Cord Hilted Spike Driver and wield that with a BoC - that\'s probably the best you can obtain without a real raid force.<br/>\n<br/>\nA few Warriors swear by SoD as an aggro weapon. I don\'t haapen to agree. I realize these things fluctuate, but generally I\'ve seen SoD\'s sell for more than BoC\'s.<br/>\nrikam<br/>\n02-05-2005, 09:28 AM<br/>\nSword of Midwinters vengeanse basicaly droppable smitar of war.<br/>\nYoda<br/>\n02-05-2005, 10:49 AM<br/>\nwell i\'m in travel so i won\'t post any numbers to explain how good the scepter of destruction is but what I can say is that, even if it\'s under the BoC, it\'s a fantastic weapons with the third best proc (anger&gt;EB&gt;anarchy) and a decent ratio (no more on part with GoD &amp; OoW ratios, but still ok) Unfortunatly I can\'t compare it without my spreadsheet to the GBoS but I wouldn\'t be surpised to see it around the same level, and thus obove all the dropable/attunable weapons (except BoC of course).<br/>\nTinman<br/>\n02-05-2005, 10:55 AM<br/>\nHere is how I feel the SoD compairs to other weapons listed so far.<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst dps<br/>\n12/18 is about equal to 15/20 which are both &lt; 14/18. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo dps wise BBC has an advantage. And BoC will have a slight advantage over the SoD. <br/>\n<br/>\nFor the procs BoC has the best. How the other two compair depends a lot on wheather you belive all stuns have the same hate value. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs for SoD compaired to the CHoS or SotBS<br/>\n<br/>\n12/18 &gt; 13/20 or 12/19. And if all stuns have the same hate then SoD has the better proc as well. However in the end I wouldn\'t be surprized if the SotBS was actually the stronger proc. But of the three I would go with the SoD.<br/>\n<br/>\nSince you have the SoD go with it . It should be more than enough for the content you menctioned.<br/>\nBrutul<br/>\n02-05-2005, 11:34 AM<br/>\nI\'d put it between a copper hammer of striking and a greatblade of storms. It\'s way overpriced though, because of the rarity of it.<br/>\nrikam<br/>\n02-05-2005, 12:07 PM<br/>\nhaha learn somthing new every day.

Even though attunables are much better stat wise your stuck with them . Plus its a chicken foot!<br/>\nEmiliaEQ<br/>\n02-06-2005, 03:54 AM<br/>\nWAY WAY too expensive for its stats/ratio/dps that are at best a bit better than most dropable aggro weapons.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut :<br/>\n1) Rocks for a twink<br/>\n2) Collector item.<br/>\n<br/>\nNot worth it even by a longshot.<br/>\nShikarii<br/>\n02-06-2005, 03:54 AM<br/>\nyeah, a SoD will never lose you money; unless one day it it\'s a common drop off orc pawns.<br/>\ni\'ve never grouped with anyone since it now procs; but it\'s definately nice...oh, and it has a little push to the proc\'s too. nothing bad though.<br/>\n<br/>\ni figure it will last you until you easily until DWing will make you eat dirt from ripostes ( or get the aa\'s to help cut it down )<br/>\nGunnar<br/>\n02-06-2005, 06:03 AM<br/>\nWell the SOD is an expensive toy. For the same money a BOC is a far better aggro weapon. I remember warriors tanking with them beside CHOS/SOTB when the droga weapons first came out. Imo they weren\'t significantly better. I couldn\'t see the difference. The BOC however was a better weapon, the difference was clear. Er as far as warrior aggro gos anyways hehe.<br/>\napolyon<br/>\n02-06-2005, 08:44 AM<br/>\nSoD was worth the money when the only decent buyable aggro weapons were BoC, SoD, and Frostbringer. As soon as the droga combo came out, though, and lots of other aggro weapons became readily available its \"worth\" went to shit.<br/>\n<br/>\nIts worth a ton because its rare and no longer drops.

Bygone butch cleaver, Sword of midwinter\'s vengeance. <br/>\n<br/>\nFor bracer there is Bracer of fickering flame somthing like that it drops in WoS at the wall(FU on saryryn). <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you go into Muramite proving grounds there is a camp called Taskmaster/Blind Hunter. The blind hunter will drop a nice earing(thornak has on) also he can drop an ac aug(thornaks bracer has aug) so worth your time to camp.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor shoulders there is a random zone drop in WoS its a shoulder item Shroud of nimble nice little shoulders with a dodge mod.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso in MPG there is another random zone drop called Maze runners ring it\'s pretty descent 145 hp 15 or so ac and cleave 1 effect.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor more info on zone drops and there names I would suggest going to <URL url=\"http://www.tcr-guild.com/darkwind\">www.tcr-guild.com/darkwind</URL> They have items drops sorted by zone and mob pretty nice.<br/>\nrikam<br/>\n02-05-2005, 08:45 AM<br/>\nOh side note the only attuneable items on there was swords and bracer rest are no drop but that just means they rot often=).<br/>\nFrostpaw<br/>\n02-05-2005, 10:39 AM<br/>\nHere are a few things you could do with just a group. <br/>\n<br/>\nFirst off, Armsmasters quests, you can use everything but the one bracer where you have Raex. All pieces but BP and legs are in my magelo. For legs and BP you might be able to get the pieces from your guild. If not, Charged Magnetic legs are player made and pretty solid. Dragorn Heirloom BP is also something you could get in a group.<br/>\n<br/>\nMazerunner Mask and Ring are from random mobs in MPG. Blue Flame necklace off random mobs in WoS. Fiercely hooked claw is decent ear from WoS.<br/>\n<br/>\n<URL url=\"http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=71145\">http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=71145</URL> is a nice little quested ear, and pieces drop off random RCoD mobs.<br/>\n<br/>\n<URL url=\"http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=71147\">http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=71147</URL> is a quested ring drops are from Rorn in RCoD and random.<br/>\n<br/>\nAug wise there is a 10ac in Ruined city, and a 15ac in WoS you can get exp\'ing. Also, a 20ac and ear in MPG from Blind Hunter, and a 55 hp aug from Odi. Stun aug from Bloodfields.<br/>\n<br/>\nWeapon wise, i would not write off your epic 1.5. If you can schedule 2 nights of 4 groups +/- you can get it.<br/>\n<br/>\nGet the stuff listed above, and then that will open up more in MPG, RS, and eventually single group MPG trials (?).<br/>\nBulletstorm<br/>\n02-05-2005, 10:44 AM<br/>\nYou can always try your luck at snagging items in MPG while your lfg or whatnot, alot of the stuff rots.<br/>\n<br/>\nLike Rikam said Warclasp Earring (<URL url=\"http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=30500\">http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=30500</URL>) You may also be able to get your hands on a Maze Runner Mask (<URL url=\"http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=30523\">http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=30523</URL>) or Maze Runner Ring (<URL url=\"http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=30500\">http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=30500</URL>), both of those drop from trash mobs. You could also see if any Kuuan Infantry Greaves (<URL url=\"http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=30598\">http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=30598</URL>) are rotting, they drop off Discordling Enchainer Kuroun.<br/>\n<br/>\nOther than those items you could try the tier 1 OoW armor quest (<URL url=\"http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=2988\"><LINK_TEXT text=\"http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/ques ... quest=2988\">http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=2988</LINK_TEXT></URL>) like frostpaw suggested<br/>\nBrutul<br/>\n02-05-2005, 10:51 AM<br/>\nI wouldn\'t buy anything that drops in WoS from the bazaar. It it all common, just get a group and go get hit. Samd for the MPG stuff. Group in there for a week or two and you can probably pick up just about everything you want.<br/>\nrikam<br/>\n02-05-2005, 11:29 AM<br/>\nBracer I listed is not bracer of flickering flame.....(too many nights reading all info i coudl on fenin event lol) Still bracer is called something like bracer of flame its from named at FU camp like i said.<br/>\napolyon<br/>\n02-06-2005, 09:58 AM<br/>\nYour weapons are fine. I would conentrate on levels/aa while at the same time working on epic 1.5 and armsmaster quests. By the time you have pieces for a few items your faction should be gold. If not go xp in MPG for a week or so, pick up the items suggested in this thread, and you should be gtg.<br/>\n<br/>\nDepending on the str of your guildamtes, after you level and xp MPG trials are a great upgrade path to some quick, very powerful gear.</r>','6dde907af7b16a62b8c1f97b4a462f62',0,'','3202k0sd',1,0,'',0,0,0,1,0,'',0),(24,24,36,2,0,'50.25.122.79',1506260211,0,1,1,1,1,'','Armsmaster helm','<r>View Full Version : Armsmaster helm<br/>\n<br/>\napolyon<br/>\n02-06-2005, 11:27 AM<br/>\nGraphic or no graphic?<br/>\n<br/>\nGot the piece yesterday and one of the ukun hides.

I managed to pick up some weaps I never would have dreamed of owning before.<br/>\n<br/>\nCurrently using CHoS and Windworn handblade. Im looking for suggestions on future upgrades. Im probably going to get a SotBS to try out the droga combo. Anyone have any suggestions for good aggro weaps to shoot for. Im looking mainly for drops that can be attained by up two to groups of 65\'s. BoC is out of the question due to price and im kind of stuck on where to go for future upgrades.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks guys...youve been awesome in the past and its great to be back.<br/>\nczai<br/>\n02-06-2005, 06:38 PM<br/>\nTongpo: Posting a magelo would help a lot as people could then make specific suggestions as to what you could upgrade. Attuneable items (droppable items that then become nodrop when you equip them) can be bought in the bazaar. CHoS/SotBS is a good combo -- I used it for quite awhile back in the day. Do some searches on this board about augments for them - there\'s a Strike of Ykesha or something similar aug that drops in Bloodfields in OoW. <br/>\n<br/>\nWork on getting to 70 and the relevant AA\'s, and on your way research some small-raid mobs that you and your guild could do with a few groups or even some boxed toons. You\'d be amazed what you can do in these days of EQ with even a minimal amount of people. <br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck.<br/>\n<br/>\nEDIT: Consider running some LDoNs. If LDoN wasn\'t out when you were still playing, they are themed dungeons where you rack up points to spend on the vendors there. They aren\'t terrible xp and the hardmode dungeons should drop some decent stuff for you, and you can save points for Anger (aggro) augs.<br/>\napolyon<br/>\n02-06-2005, 06:49 PM<br/>\nTo the poster: Get with your friends and grind out towards level 65 at least. LDoN is your friend. OoW droppables in the bazaar are your friend. Once you get into your 60\'s raid the BoTowers with whoever you can russle up and try to grab an ornate bp and a GBoS. The newer expansions have tons of gear buyable and from single groupable encounters.<br/>\ncloudwalker21<br/>\n02-06-2005, 07:14 PM<br/>\nThe droga weapons combo will last you into your 60\'s once you get them decked out with stuns/a3\'s. If you have a magelo, I could make some suggestions on some slots that you might want to upgrade. If you want weapons though, bygone butcher\'s cleaver or sword of midwinter\'s vengeance would be well worth it if you\'re able to afford one of them. Also there\'s a sword from the Kyv HeadHunter I think it is in DS...lets see...its something scimitar. Has a ykesha proc on it, 13/21 (if I remember right) and -ok- stats. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you\'re looking to try a 2 hander, cannot go wrong with GSoT. Great aggro, and stats are not bad either.<br/>\nFrostpaw<br/>\n02-06-2005, 07:51 PM<br/>\nStun aug from Bloodfields is great advice from Czai, put in your main hand. LDoN for a second agro aug when you can.<br/>\n<br/>\nGet up to date on new quests out of Omens, they are----&gt;&gt; SOLID GOLD. Armsmaster\'s visible slot armor, Muramite Officers Ring, Gilded Earring of Travels, Cloak of the Dragorn Militia, are all worth pursuing. If you learn about them early, you can get a jump on working faction for them and collecting the drops you will need for them. If guildies are hunting in WoS or Ruined City, offer to go along and DPS out of group hoping for quest drops while you are looking for a group. Once you level a bit you can get them in groups of your own. If I was level 58, my goal would be to have every drop I need for at least 6 slots worth of Armsmasters the minute you can do the turn ins (64 i believe, but double check).<br/>\n<br/>\nAcquaint yourself with some of the new money maker tradeskill drops. Discordant Scoriae, Kyanite, Slugwoms, Lightning Cores (there are others like the mana aug, etc... ask around in guild). You will see these occcasionally in your travels, and if you dont know what they are and that they sell for huge cash, then random_lootwhore_01 will make fat cash while you don\'t even realize you are missing out.<br/>\n<br/>\nBe thinking about your epic 1.5 when the time comes.

It is the community of ppl like yourselfs that is the major deciding factor to my return eq. Even the greatest game in the world, with all the newest bells and whistles can be turned into a stinking pile of dog crap if it doesnt have a great community of players willing to take the time to help folks and to just simply have fun.<br/>\nVilicontus<br/>\n02-08-2005, 01:06 PM<br/>\n*Self praise alert*<br/>\n<br/>\nTongpo, read my thread (<URL url=\"http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?t=10493\"><LINK_TEXT text=\"http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/sh ... hp?t=10493\">http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?t=10493</LINK_TEXT></URL>) here. You\'re not in any shape to get it right now, but once your group of friends are capable of handling adds and you\'ve gained some needed HP/AC, the shoulder drop from the new Mistmoore Castle zone is one of the best available to us right now.<br/>\nBrabble<br/>\n02-08-2005, 01:07 PM<br/>\nLizards can wear Kylong stuff, I think. The guantlets are 23 AC, 10 STA, 5 DEX, 45HP.<br/>\nNot uber, but a bump and perhaps affordable. <br/>\nI\'d poke around EQ rankings too &amp; look to see what other folks are wearing. Sometimes you can get some good ideas there.<br/>\nKeep trying with the LDoNs. The weapon augs are a long haul, but minor augments sometimes drop in the course of adventures/killing named, and you can pick up some STA &amp; DEX that way--basically just fill in your slots until something better comes along, as every little bit helps. My 57 warrior increased the number of LDoN groups he could get recently by deciding that 2 normals got him more points than a night of waiting for a cleric to show up to do a hard; now he just grabs whoever is around and does normals as fast as possible. Four out of five LDoNs he\'s done lately have been mellee groups without true healers. Sometimes we have a pally for pac/heals, but often no classic crowd control and I pull everything until we get to rooms where pac is worth the time. You sort of need a lot of coffee and stick to bite down on to keep from falling asleep/going crazy, but you\'ll wait forever for a cleric and chanter to show up. I think pack shrew must come from Everfrost, because there seem to be a few rangers lurking about in their mid 50s willing to do EFs.<br/>\nI\'m pretty sure that there are bazaar upgrades to just about everything you\'re wearing, but as you say you\'ve been checking prices on your server I suspect you\'ll know an affordable upgrade when you see one, heh.<br/>\nGood luck.<br/>\nwerdara<br/>\n02-08-2005, 05:48 PM<br/>\nGauntlets of the Slavetrader are as easy to get as the boots you have. Common drop in Harbingers. Any Enc / Cleric worth their pacify can single pull that camp. As you come in Harbingers, go straight, past the first square room, and take your first left. Back right mob is the PH for the guy that drops gloves.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, not sure if you camped or bought the Slavetrader boots, but if you camped them, the BP is pretty nice and is the same guy that drops boots. Enter Harbingers, take 2nd right, and then 1st right, again he\'s the back right mob. Its not much of an upgrade to Archi, but its slightly more melee oriented.<br/>\n<br/>\nLeggings, you can get nice Bloodied Dragorn Greaves from Bloodfields. Go all the way across to RCoD zone, in the castle/halls there. First left, 2nd or 3rd mob on the left in the big room drops arms (not as good as repentance) and legs rarely, which are very nice. His name is Captain Gherish. At that same camp (camp at the 4 way intersection) you can pull the rightmost room down the right hall, and the guy there, Ltn Lihad, drops a fair 2hander commonly and a nice melee oriented earring rarely. Name is Earring of the Fallen. You can also pull Clergyman camp which is right then left, also pullable from same camp. He\'s back left mob. Doesn\'t drop anything you\'d want, but his ring is a fair hybrid item and hammer is a sub-par but ok melee weapon.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor a cloak, check bazaar for Shroud of the Fallen Defender. Great backpiece that is War only, so price bottomed out quickly. You can probably pick it up for 4-5k and on top of nice stats, it has a 30 ac clicky buff that stacks with anything you could possibly have before Time or RSS. (Doesn\'t stack with any other Form of xxx spell)<br/>\n<br/>\nBack to Harbingers for a moment, for a facepiece. Take 2nd right (toward Armsmaster) then stay straight on until you get to the square room with 4 discordlings. 2 of the 4 are PH\'s for named, and the far right (Discordling stalker) commonly drops a decent Mask of the Kuua. Just make sure one of your healers has a way to remove curses, because both named there use Chaotica which is a nasty hour long hp/mana dot that overwrites KEI. You can tempt them into staying there by mentioning that Toiler Opanin, the first mob in the hall behind you, drops an FT1 aug for them <E>;)</E> The mask isn\'t much of an upgrade for you, but if you\'re there for the FT aug to repay them, you might as well pull for the mask while you\'re at it.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs a side note, with my 65 Enc, when I\'m able to focus on pulling, I can pull every bottom floor named in Harbingers for a group set up at Armsmaster camp, aside from that one guy in the room with about 15 mobs. Peon Something, drops chain helm and BP. We even have time to clear a dozen trash mobs while we wait for the 8 or 9 named/ph spawns. Pacify is your friend in Harbingers.<br/>\n<br/>\nWelcome back Warrior!<br/>\nGaspie<br/>\n02-08-2005, 06:37 PM<br/>\nGauntlets of the Slavetrader are as easy to get as the boots you have.

If you check the magelos of most real high end warriors across EQ, you\'ll probably notice that they all wear similar or the same masks. That\'s baecause the availability of good ones are really slim to none. It\'s not that they don\'t exist, because they do, it\'s that they\'re sometimes in somewhat hard places to get to like Uqua (Allakhazam shows two pretty good masks in Uqua and one off Noqufiel). <br/>\n<br/>\nVisor of the Berseker - 52ac/195hp (Rallos Zek)<br/>\nFaceguard of Frenzy - 60ac/175hp (Avatar of the Elementas and Supernatural Guardian)<br/>\nChailak Hide Mask - 40ac/235hp +10CA (Chailak)<br/>\nDragorn Runemark - 25ac/185hp +10avd (Hulcror)<br/>\nVeil of the Inferno - 32ac/185hp + 180hp clicky (Bertoxxulous)<br/>\nEyepatch of Expert Archery - 40ac 210hp (Efficiency trial)<br/>\nCynin\'s Mask - 38ac/275hp (King Galequa)<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you have the DKP to spare, the Chailak Hide Mask isn\'t a bad upgrade.

I have a question about agro and weapons... I end up tanking for my group and need to keep agro. I\'m a level 70 bard with WA5 and Fury of Magic 1. My group is 65 cleric (100-ishAAs) and level 70 rogue (170AAs). I swap in weapons as needed for things like tash, snare, and avatar. My only choice left is when all else has proc\'ed... what\'s my dps/agro weapon? Currently I use Dedgerex\'s Flintforged Cudgel (<URL url=\"http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=68419\">http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=68419</URL>) with a nice 625dd (crits at 1250!) proc, but the damage/delay is quite lackluster. Alternately I could use a Lava Infused Bludgeon (<URL url=\"http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=28833\">http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=28833</URL>) with 160dd (320 crits aren\'t nearly as fun to see as 1250 though!) proc.<br/>\n<br/>\nDPS used to be a my focus, but now agro is a big deal since I\'ve moved to OoW and my cleric is having to heal me MUCH more often. So I look to the experts to let me know which of my weapons would be the better agro generator...<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for any advice!<br/>\n<br/>\n-OneManBand<br/>\nShikarii<br/>\n02-07-2005, 08:32 AM<br/>\nwell, DD\'s suck for aggro <E>:D</E><br/>\n<br/>\nI\'d ry out the droga pair; Copper Hammer of Striking and a Sword of the Bloodsworn.<br/>\nOr ( if you could use it ) maybe even a bygone butcher\'s cleaver..offhand i forget the req classes. Without knowing what you can hunt for too makes the choices rough ( if you cold convince people to go with you to BoT for a greatblade of storms if you could use it as well )...<br/>\n<br/>\nBut know that maxxing for DPS or Aggro is going to cause one of those choices to fall behind a bit.<br/>\nStyal Fortis<br/>\n02-07-2005, 08:44 AM<br/>\nYeah stun procs on the CHoS and Sword of the Bloodsworn work great. Also, since you\'re a bard, your boastful bellow song (is that what it\'s called?) has a stun on it, doesn\'t it?<br/>\n<br/>\nDon\'t get a BoC though, that\'s for warriors only! It should be anyway!<br/>\nKogur<br/>\n02-07-2005, 08:56 AM<br/>\nGet a BoC and slap a yak aggro on it!

Buy the 2nd aug from LDoN. (or both if you have enough points and don\'t wanna camp)<br/>\nBrutul<br/>\n02-07-2005, 09:17 AM<br/>\nBards have innate de-aggro for spells. Stun/Ykesha weapons won\'t help at all. The only weapon that is bard useable to help with aggro is a BoC. I think most bards that tank just do it by twisting as many DoTs as possible, but a bard\'s aggro will never be reliable. Basically unless you get a BoC, DPS is *still* your focus, because it\'s about your only means of getting aggro.<br/>\nBrael<br/>\n02-07-2005, 11:15 AM<br/>\nUse Ykesha augmented weapons and twist dots. Also don\'t buy casting subtlety it will just make your job harder.<br/>\nsnasty<br/>\n02-07-2005, 11:26 AM<br/>\nYou need to use your chants. Depending on your weapons you may be able to get by with less chants. If you have bad weapons I would suggest equip a drum and sing 4 chants. I can get by with using 2 chants with my weapons and have little trouble holding aggro provided the people in my group know they need to hold off a bit. If the slower waits to 95% to slow and the rogue waits to 90% to engage and evades I rarely lose aggro. If the enchanter tashes and slows right off just wait til he dies then you will have aggro back <E>:)</E> The use of Bellow (AA item) can also help.<br/>\napolyon<br/>\n02-07-2005, 12:21 PM<br/>\nFriend plays a bard ... yes BoC + yak will be good aggro.

I\'ve always been able to hold aggro in these groups, even when the BoC useing tank can match my two a3 aguments. Therefore I would say that the difference between the BBC and the BoC is less than the differance between using incite and not using incite. I don\'t off tank with the BBC so I can\'t comment form the other side. <br/>\n<br/>\nPerhaps the question you should asks yourself is weather you need to upgrade or not, and wheather you have your best aggro weapon main hand. <br/>\n<br/>\nBy the late 60\'s 13/19 &gt; 18/24. And i\'m not sure but it is very possable that the proc on the CHSD &gt; the porc on the MoM.

In xp group situations I have no aggro issues, in the raids that we do, I have the normal trash mob warrior aggro issue caused by fast clearing, and no aggro issues on any of the final raid targets we kill.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn this case, no aggro issues means none of the boss mobs I\'ve tanked have ever turned and hit someone else during the fight. (And to be honest, much of that time was with the BBC auged with the BF aug).<br/>\n<br/>\nAre other weapons better aggro? Yes. Are the mobs I\'m tanking something that most people would scoff at? Perhaps. Does the BBC aggro \'suck\'? No. Can you tank with a BBC and have sucky aggro? Yes. Can you tank with a BoC and have sucky aggro? Yes. Is there more to holding aggro than hitting the mob with your favourite weapon? Yes.<br/>\napolyon<br/>\n02-08-2005, 06:46 AM<br/>\nAs pointed out you can\'t resell an attunable weapon. I doubt the value of the BoC will ever depreciate, so the BoC is the best value.<br/>\n<br/>\nBBC doesnt hold a candle to a BoC, and i\'d state my prooftext as my OSoW in my pack. Same exact weapon from PoP but it has a proc mod. It was decent/good aggro but didnt come anywhere close to my BoC. You can get by with it for sure but they arent even in the same ballpark.<br/>\nVulpes<br/>\n02-08-2005, 02:16 PM<br/>\nThat\'s much more than a BBC is worth for a start - on Rathe where BoC is routinely 300k, BBC only goes for 50 or so.<br/>\n<br/>\nBuy BoC. As has been said, it won\'t devalue much so in reality you a paying a trivial amount to \'rent\' it until you get a better weapon.<br/>\nBrutul<br/>\n02-08-2005, 02:21 PM<br/>\nIt\'s usually good advice to hold off on major purchases when a new expansion is about to be released. You never know what kind of stuff will be popping up the first couple weeks of DoN that could totally change the value of this stuff or may be be a better option for you.<br/>\nBokbok<br/>\n02-08-2005, 03:52 PM<br/>\nUp untill four days ago I have been using a BBC in main hand and SOTB in secoundary.... I held agro fine .... Bottom line is I solved my agro issues not by changing weponds but learning how to handle group members that would take agro needlessly.. So BBC is fine in my book.. But at the same time when i had a chanch I did buy a BOC for 250 K ....and now use BBC in secoundary.. Do I notice a difference ..... NO ... is it nice having a wepon i can resell later to buy something else .. YES....<br/>\n<br/>\nSo between the two if I have the cash I would go with the BOC.. <br/>\n<br/>\nBok<br/>\nTinman<br/>\n02-08-2005, 04:37 PM<br/>\nBBC doesnt hold a candle to a BoC, and i\'d state my prooftext as my OSoW in my pack. Same exact weapon from PoP but it has a proc mod. It was decent/good aggro but didnt come anywhere close to my BoC. You can get by with it for sure but they arent even <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen is BBC &gt; BoC until the BoC procs. 14/18 &gt; 15/20 by a noticable amount.<br/>\nWhen is BoC &gt; BBC after it porcs. <br/>\n<br/>\nHow much aggro is the BBC proc? You don\'t know. None of you can tell me how many aggro point it is worth. The thing you need to remember is there is no way to relate events like stun and debuf to hp damage. The amount of hate such procs produce is just a line of code. Just like the anger procs. There is just a line of code that says incresses hate by x amount. And there is no reason why x has to be a constant for different stun procs or diferent debuf procs or one anger procs ( as in a2 vs a3 the only difference in the code is the value of x). <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen is the hardest time for a warrior to hold aggro?<br/>\nAt the start of the fight, before the mob is slowed. There is alot more healing in less time pre slow. And odds are if you do loss aggro you will loss it to the slower. <br/>\n<br/>\nFor one group content slow is normally cast during the first 10 seconed. <br/>\nWhat are the odds of the BoC proc procing duing these 10 seconds? About 33%. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn other words about 67% of the time weather you hold aggro or not during the most critical part of the fight is determained by the dps aggro of the weapon and not the proc aggro of the weapon.<br/>\napolyon<br/>\n02-08-2005, 04:43 PM<br/>\n14/18 is not greater than 15/20 such that 14/18 will ever allow you to hold aggro when you don\'t get procs through a slow where 15/20 will not.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlain and simple. There is never an instance where a BBC is better aggro than a BoC in the exact same manner that there is never an instance where a 14/19 + lifetap will let you hold aggro better than a 13/20 + stun. Ratio is important, but small ratio differences will not (please repeat after me) WILL NOT make up for a far lesser proc.<br/>\n<br/>\nBest etimates put debuff aggro aroun 350-400 tops in my book. I\'ve used and still currently have a weapon in my inventory with a debuff mod on it. It\'s good aggro but it doesnt hold a candle to EB. It\'s good but not quite as solid as a stun proc. You can get by with a BBC just freakin fine 99% of the time, just don\'t go so far as to say its as good a a BoC. <E>:D</E> <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen is the most critical time for aggro in an xp group for myself? Right around 50% when the necro/shaman dots have really kicked in and are rolling nicely and/or wizards start to open up. I\'ve not had aggro problems for tash/slow since i got baze bellow. At times like those i just mentioned, the buildup of EB procs vs lifetap/stun/debuff procs over the course of the fight is painfully obvious. <br/>\n<br/>\nEverytime my lifetap/debuff proc fires in fights where i\'m grouped with a hardcore necro/rogue/shaman/wizard, baby jesus cries.<br/>\nwerdara<br/>\n02-08-2005, 05:18 PM<br/>\nThanks for the input all. I\'d like to respond to a few of the comments real fast.<br/>\n<br/>\nWork on 1.5. I am, halfway done, but my guild has now shrunk to small to field even 2 groups most of the time, so it\'ll be a long road. The idea was if I bought a BoC, I\'d def put it in seconday when I got 1.5. <E>:)</E> <br/>\n<br/>\nStill not sure why so many people rank the MoM so low. I love mine. It\'s a bit slower than some, but fully hasted you\'re talking about 2.5 delay more than CHSD? Versus 5 more raw damage? I\'m gonna dig up the calculator and check, but I\'m thinking 2.5 delay is only going to be 3-4 swings per minute less, which is only 3-4 more dmg bonuses going up against 5 more raw dmg every swing on MoM. I personally rank stuns at around 500 aggro after the dd aggro is figured in, so its at least equal to the CHSD on proc, and has more HP on the weapon itself. Of course, with 3 yak procs, I can outpush a BST and his pet consistantly <E>:eek:</E> but sometimes thats a boon. I\'ve learned to cope until I can afford A3s.<br/>\n<br/>\nDefinitely going to wait for the BoC. Anything that might hit with DoN I doubt will be easily achieveable for me unless its 1 groupable stuff and I can tank for friends in bigger guilds.<br/>\nTinman<br/>\n02-08-2005, 06:52 PM<br/>\n14/18 is not greater than 15/20 such that 14/18 will ever allow you to hold aggro when you don\'t get procs through a slow where 15/20 will not. <br/>\n<br/>\nHere is some simple math for you. The common equation used to compair weapons dps is (2(damage) + bonus)/delay. <br/>\nUsing the above equation you can convert a 14/18 weapon to a 18/20 weapon. If you want to believe that 15/20 is about the same thing as 18/20... okyou can. <br/>\n<br/>\nFurthermore the 18 delay weapon gets 5% more dps out of each damage bonus. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nbut small ratio differences will not (please repeat after me) WILL NOT make up for a far lesser proc. <br/>\nBest etimates put debuff aggro aroun 350-400 tops in my book.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease note you have not stated how much hate is generated by the BBC proc. Stateing your estimate is just that a guess. Therefore you can not state weather it is a lesse proc or a far lesser porc. I think most will agree that the BBC\'s proc is smaller than the BoC proc but you do not know by how much. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I am confident of is that there is a bigger differance in pressing or not pressing Incite than there is between the BoC and BCC procs. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen is the most critical time for aggro in an xp group for myself? Right around 50% when the necro/shaman dots have really kicked in and are rolling nicely and/or wizards start to open up. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe thing to remember is that the casting of dots, or the opening up by dd casters is a choice made by the caster. Also the caster can adjust the amount of dd or dot they cast and the size of the dd or the dot. In short you are talking about casters over aggroing. <br/>\n<br/>\nHowever the slower must slow, and they can\'t adjust the hate generated by the slow. And the healer must heal and the amount of damage that needs to be healed determains the amount of hate gained by the healer. <br/>\n<br/>\nI think it is great that Bazu Bellow has freed you from the strugle of generating suffent hate preslow. <br/>\n<br/>\nOh and by the way, lossing aggro at about the same time during a fight suggest that your dps is what is lacking. Simply put the hate of the DoT stack &gt; your dps + Bazu Bellow. Just out of cureosity are you able to regain aggor with out a proc?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nEverytime my lifetap/debuff proc fires in fights where i\'m grouped with a hardcore necro/rogue/shaman/wizard, baby jesus cries. <br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe you should lower yourself and do some more Advs and replace that tird old lifetap proc, and give Baby Jesus a break...not to menction the shaman and necros....who knows maybe you will be able to even hold on to aggro mid fight...<br/>\nSarcazzm<br/>\n02-08-2005, 07:08 PM<br/>\nCurrently using MoM with Yak in Pri, and CHSD with Yak in Sec.<br/>\n<br/>\nCame into some cash thru a stroke of luck and have about 200k atm.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can buy a Bygone Butcher\'s Cleaver for 135k right now.<br/>\nBoC runs about 300k, but I can probably trade 200k + Fungi for it if I\'m patient.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlan on moving MoM to Sec, and making new weapon Pri.<br/>\n<br/>\nThoughts? BoC is obviously better, but how much? I almost never have aggro probs as it is.<br/>\n<br/>\nUsing a BoC Primary with MoM offhand I rarely have agro problems against similarly geared warriors, and barely struggle with other melee\'s. knights can always be a pain.<br/>\n<br/>\nBoth items are painfully overpriced on your server. BBC etc will work, but there simply is no substitute for enraging blow+, and i can now testify, that testing it along with Jagged Antiquity (less dps similar proc, same proc?), and the proc was shameful compaired to EB, imo almost non existant.<br/>\n<br/>\nthe end all be all of this question isnt will a BBC work for you, im sure it will properly auged with anger3, I wouldnt suggest a yak aug unless the weapon in question already has a very strong hate proc.<br/>\n<br/>\nthe question should be this: do you have the cash for the very best, and if so do you really want to blow 135k for a sub-par weapon? i\'d go all the way, BoC is still the king of baz agro.<br/>\nTinman<br/>\n02-08-2005, 07:21 PM<br/>\nStill not sure why so many people rank the MoM so low. I love mine. It\'s a bit slower than some, but fully hasted you\'re talking about 2.5 delay more than CHSD? <br/>\n<br/>\nThe thing to remember is the effect of the primary hand damage bonus. For one handed weapons the bonus is a function only of lvl, the weapon delay has no impact. Just to make the math symple lets compair a weapon with a delay of 18 to one with a delay of 24. if we set the 24 delay as a standard then each time it gains a 1 the 18 delay weapons effective gain is 1.25. So when the damage bonues is 4 for the 24 dealy the effective bouns is 5 for the 18 delay. That is why in the primay hand low delay weapons can have better dps that slower weapons with a better ratio. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe idea was if I bought a BoC, I\'d def put it in seconday when I got 1.5.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think if you have the plat for a BoC great. It is one of the best buyable primary weapons in the game......but I\'m not so sure it would be wise to buy it with the intent of it spending most of it\'s time as a seconday weapon. After all what do you get for spending over 200k? you get 0.8 (700) worth of aggro/minute. In other wrods you are paying 200 K for 560 hate per minute? (if my math is right, don\'t have a calculater handy). After all there are any number of weapons that can be obtained in any number of ways with as good ro better ratio. <br/>\nIs a 540 hate porc /minute worth 200k plat? <br/>\nGuess it is up to the indavidual.<br/>\nTinman<br/>\n02-08-2005, 07:26 PM<br/>\nand i can now testify, that testing it along with Jagged Antiquity (less dps similar proc, same proc?), and the proc was shameful compaired to EB, imo almost non existant. <br/>\n<br/>\nSarcazzm, can you post your test methood, and a summury of the results?<br/>\nSarcazzm<br/>\n02-08-2005, 07:30 PM<br/>\nthe test is simple, i put my prismatic mace in offhand with ornate click haste, and stack immolation of sun, swarming death, and vengance of nature on a mob with the druid (blue mobs) in bloodfeilds. one proc from the BoC and agro is pretty set, whereas i struggle for agro the entire fight with the jaggy mainhand.<br/>\n<br/>\ni cbf\'d for parsing, i play a game, im not a scientist <E>:)</E><br/>\nwerdara<br/>\n02-08-2005, 10:09 PM<br/>\nHere is some simple math for you. The common equation used to compair weapons dps is (2(damage) + bonus)/delay. <br/>\nUsing the above equation you can convert a 14/18 weapon to a 18/20 weapon. If you want to believe that 15/20 is about the same thing as 18/20... okyou can. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nUm, you can tell by looking at those numbers that either the formula or the math was wrong... There\'s NO WAY that you need to increase 2 base dmg for every 1 increase in delay to make an equivalent slower weapon. I couldn\'t remember the dmg bonus at 65, so I plugged in your numbers and calculated the dmg bonus as the variable of the equation.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd you evidently figure the dmg bonus to be 44?<br/>\n<br/>\nAssuming 14/18 = 18/20, and Z represents dmg bonus.<br/>\n<br/>\n(2(14) + Z)/18 = (2(18) + Z)/20<br/>\n<br/>\n(28 + Z)/18 = (36 + Z)/20<br/>\n<br/>\n560 + 20Z = 648 + 18Z<br/>\n<br/>\n2Z = 88<br/>\n<br/>\nZ = 44 <E>:eek:</E> <br/>\n<br/>\nSo I logged into EQ and checked. The dmg bonus at 70 is 15.<br/>\nUsing that number, and leaving the dmg of the 20 delay weapon as the variable..<br/>\nnot gonna write that all out... we get 16.388<br/>\n<br/>\nSo a 14/18 weapon = 16.4/20 weapon, at 70. Yes, slightly above a BoC. Actually 109.3% of the value of a 15/20, in terms of damage. <E>:)</E> You will gain 9% more damage with a 14/18 than with a 15/20. Which I suppose translates to 9% more aggro, since we know aggro from swings is based on potential dmg.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile I was at it, I valued my MoM vs CHSD vs BBC vs BoC<br/>\n<br/>\nMoM = 2.125<br/>\nCHSD = 2.158<br/>\nBBC = 2.389<br/>\nBoC = 2.25<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd to satisfy my own curiousity, a 24 delay weapon would need to have 20 damage to surpass a BoC in swing aggro.<br/>\nElfried<br/>\n02-09-2005, 02:00 AM<br/>\nHi,<br/>\n<br/>\ni am reading this thread and another Question comes to my mind.<br/>\nI remember that i read something like:<br/>\n<br/>\n\"The delay of your weapon cannot be smaller then 10.\"<br/>\n<br/>\nIs this true?<br/>\nIf yes then at 100% haste a 14/18 weapon would be 14/10 and a 15/20 weapon would be 15/10. With bard Overhaste you could bring even slower weapons to a hasted delay of 10. That would mean that for weapons up to 24 delay (with 130% haste) have the same hasted delay. So the damage would be more important then delay on fast weapons.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs i said, i dont\'t know if this is true. Perhaps someone can answer this.<br/>\nYoda<br/>\n02-09-2005, 02:49 AM<br/>\nit\'s wrong, it was a very very very old fear because eq\'s logs have a 1s (thus 10delay) step, but a BBotE at 130% haste won\'t have any troubles in having a round\'s period of less than 1s.<br/>\n<br/>\nbtw, if you want to compare dps with the formula (2*DM+DB)/DL ok but please don\'t use it for melee aggro comparaison \'cause baby jesus screams to death everytimes some does it.<br/>\nremember that aggro melee formula for war is (DM+DB*1.4/(1-hatemod))/DL<br/>\nso a BB\'sC is around 5.45% more melee\'s aggro than a BoC, but it can\'t compete with the proc difference.<br/>\nTinman<br/>\n02-09-2005, 04:30 AM<br/>\nZ = 44 <br/>\n<br/>\nOk so you can use that equation to make equivent delay weapons. <br/>\n<br/>\nMoM = 2.125<br/>\nCHSD = 2.158<br/>\nBBC = 2.389<br/>\nBoC = 2.25 <br/>\n<br/>\nSo the CHSD is as much dps as the MoM. If you think the procs are the same then it really dosen\'t matter which is the primary.<br/>\n<br/>\nsince we know aggro from swings is based on potential dmg. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen this theroy was first put forth I looked at the data summerys. It showed a slight verance on the number of swings needed to reach the same aggro. A verance of one or two. To me any verance in the number of swings suggest the theroy needs refinement. In the end the potential damage ends up being about the same things as dps. <br/>\n<br/>\nremember that aggro melee formula for war is (DM+DB*1.4/(1-hatemod))/DL <br/>\n<br/>\nAs I recall Yoda your total aggro calculator spits out some very questionable results. It is the melee aggro formula or the proc aggro assumctions that needs to be adjusted?<br/>\n<br/>\nthe test is simple, i put my prismatic mace in offhand with ornate click haste, and stack immolation of sun, swarming death, and vengance of nature on a mob with the druid (blue mobs) in bloodfeilds. one proc from the BoC and agro is pretty set, whereas <br/>\n<br/>\nThe test as you designed it compairs total aggro. <br/>\n<br/>\nSince you say that aggro is pretty set after on proc from the BoC apprently the BoC dose loss aggro after the proc some of the time. This means that the per tick aggro of the dot stack is greatter than the per tick aggro of the BoC dps. <br/>\nFurthermore since you cast the dots and the start meleeing the dots have a head start. <br/>\nSince 15/20 &gt; 13/20 the JA would need a bigger proc to regain aggro. <br/>\nIn short you have proven that the BoC has better total aggro than the JA. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis would be an intresting test to run on the CHoS and the JA. You might want to have the druid generate less aggro. Your test would show a differance in hate generated by proc if the weapons had the same ratio. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nbut it can\'t compete with the proc difference. <br/>\n<br/>\nHow much hate did you say the BBC proc generates? Oh that is right you didn\'t say. <br/>\nIs the BoC proc larger than the BBC proc ? Probably<br/>\nIs it 100 more? Is it 200 More? We just don\'t know. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf a tank has 100 dps then it seems to me that a 9% increasses in dps or even a 5% increasses in dps is a significent amount. <br/>\nA 5% dps increasses is 300 dpm<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the end the question isn\'t is the BBC better than the BoC . I don\'t think anyone has suggested it is. The question is how much better is the BoC than the BBC. We all have our favorite meathoods of determining how much aggro is generated by dps. And all these meathoods show the BBC has better dps aggro.<br/>\nWe all agree that the BoC proc is bigger. We just don\'t know how much bigger. <br/>\nSince we don\'t know the proc value of the BBC we can not say how much of a differance there is in the total hate generated by the two weapons. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt seems strange that some of the people who were so against going with a gut feel in the GSoT vs Droga post, are willing to go with their gut on proc differances. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn the end I stand by my statment:<br/>\nThe total aggro differance between the BoC and the BBC is less than the amount of aggro generated by Incite.<br/>\nBrabble<br/>\n02-09-2005, 07:09 AM<br/>\nI\'m not sure that Yoda\'s melee formula is absolutely correct, but unless I\'m mistaken it is at least in part backed by some fairly good testing by Brael et al.<br/>\nBut I\'m pretty sure that exact melee aggro formulas are a small part of the answer to Werdara\'s question.<br/>\nBoC is at the moment top dropable 1h hate. the other weapon is going to be less hate and not re-sellable, iirc.<br/>\nSo, the decision is going to rest on a couple of issues. Is Werdara so desperate for a hate upgrade that the BBC will do at the loss of 135K plat? Partly that\'s also a function of who W. is playing with (that is, how often W is MT) and also how long this upgrade would last. (nothing like spending 100K on attunable pieces and a week later falling into an unexpected upgrade to generate a truly Homer Simpson moment).<br/>\nAnother element in the decision is what else W. could do with the plat difference between BoC and BBC. W. could look at current haste and other potentially expensive upgrades and make that judgement.<br/>\nThe BoC is going to be re-sellable and has held value pretty well. But Brutal\'s point is well taken: a new expansion is coming, which is often not the best time to buy a \"top dropable\" piece of gear, especially one that\'s been on the top for as long as the BoC. Whatever the expansion has in it, the BoC is unlikely to go up in price dramatically, but it could fall.<br/>\nWhat I guess I\'d do is ask myself this question: How\'s my aggro right now? Am I frequently losing it, causing big problems/wipes or significantly throttling the damage my groups/raids are doing? Nothing re-orients an MT\'s priorities like having obviously bad aggro problems, and if that\'s the situation, fix it now by any means possible.<br/>\nBut if it isn\'t, I\'d look at earning out the BoC, waiting to see what else turns up, perhaps working on epic and \\ if possible GBoS.<br/>\napolyon<br/>\n02-09-2005, 08:02 AM<br/>\nOnce again the arena sports Tinman vs logic (everyone else).<br/>\n<br/>\nNo ... 14/18 is not better than 15/20 such that 14/18 dps aggro will let you hold aggro where 15/20 will not. <br/>\n<br/>\nBefore you open your mouth again to spew forth whatever curveballs you have yet to unleash check out my magelo. You will see, if you look hard enough, that i have a 14/18 weapon in my pack that i used as a staple for aggro for a full 12 months. Also please check out the 15/19 debuff weapon i have. Please also note that i owned a BoC for 12 months as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow ... before you say anything please undstand that i have infinitely more experience with most weapon types, procs, and these specific ratios than you have now ... and that i bet you probably ever will have. 14/18 is better than 15/20 mainhand, but not such that it will ever let it overcome an innate EB proc. If 15/20 won\'t help yuo hold through tash/slow from melee aggro alone, then 15/20 sure as fuck won\'t either. I know this, because i\'ve used both of these exact ratios.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs to the proc itself, once again i\'ve used all 4 (stun/debuff/EB/anger3) significantly. It\'s pretty apparent debuff is the weakest of the 3 by a rather margin.<br/>\n<br/>\nYour dps aggro is lacking<br/>\n<br/>\n:Laugh<br/>\nCheck out my weaponry. Now, check out your weaponry. Now, check out my aa\'s. Now, check out your aa\'s. I don\'t want to make this a penis waving contest about who plays longer/harder, but i can\'t believe you\'re telling me that my dps aggro is what\'s causing my aggro loss. I can sustain 200+ dps constantly in fights. Can you? Perhaps you\'ll tell me a 14/18 primary weapon will help me hold aggro better than my 28/26?<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe you should lower yourself and do some more Advs and replace that tird old lifetap proc, and give Baby Jesus a break...not to menction the shaman and necros....who knows maybe you will be able to even hold on to aggro mid fight...<br/>\n<br/>\nGood lord, i\'m having a hard time believing you\'re this dense. I have 3x anger3 with a lifetap proc innately on the trident. I also happen to have a GBoS + Anger3 sitting in my pack for tiems when i think my aggro could possibly be lacking. The entire point of what i was saying was that with today\'s tools, today\'s warriors biggest aggro loss problems should be mid-fight when the buildup of procs in the fight hasnt lead to sufficient hate for aggro to maintain solid. IE: debuff buildup won\'t be as strong as debuff buildup. But then again, i havent taken a WoS group in 6 months and the dps folks i group with are very well geared and generate some massive mid-fight aggro when it all really unfolds.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease don\'t turn this into another huge debate. It\'s not worth your time OR my time. The result will be the same as last time, where you tried to convince everyont that a 14/19 lifetap weapon could be as good as a BoC. It\'s not that difficult man. It really isnt.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe answer to your question is this: BoC and BBC are in completely different aggro ballparks. The dps aggro is better on BBC but not by much. The proc aggro on BoC is almost fully twice that of BBC. The end result is pretty huge. I don\'t think anyone who has owned both weapons or used very similar setups would disagree. The problem is when we have folks who\'ve only used half the weaponry come here and try to guestimate with F\'ed up equations the way things *should* work.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe total aggro differance between the BoC and the BBC is less than the amount of aggro generated by Incite.<br/>\n<br/>\nTime to roll a new class man.<br/>\nBrutul<br/>\n02-09-2005, 09:54 AM<br/>\nThread summary. <br/>\n<br/>\n1) BoC is better aggro than a BBC by an undetermined amount. <br/>\n2) If you like, you can use some BS equations to either prove or disprove this.<br/>\n3) Don\'t buy high-priced upgrades a week before a new expansion. <br/>\n4) Minimum weapon delay is NOT 10, but this myth seems to be impossible to stop<br/>\n5) The End<br/>\nBrutul<br/>\n02-09-2005, 12:09 PM<br/>\nAdding to this because the Dragons of Norrath Beta NDA was lifted today.

The reasoning for this; the Blade of Stategy proc makes a check vs the fire (I believe?) resists of an enemy, which is often resisted, while the BoC is impossible to resist ever. Your mainhand weapon will proc more often than your offhand weapon, so you want to have more procs per minute of enraging blow than you do of rage of vallon. Furthermore, the aggro value of enraging blow is higher than that of rage of vallon. Finally, the ratio of the BoC is also superior to the Blade of Strategy.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, bearing that in mind, there are other weapons that you could offhand that would be much better than the Blade of Strategy. If you are absolutely intent on using your epic, honestly, if it\'s sentimental to you or some such reason (and this will most likely affect the quality of your aggro negatively over using dual wield) use the two hander and anger augment it.<br/>\nYoda<br/>\n02-08-2005, 09:38 AM<br/>\nyes it makes a huge difference... you will cut your aggro in half <E>:)</E><br/>\nwell actually it won\'t be cut in half but \'only\' 7% less or more precisely you will downgrade from 134 hate per seconde to 124 hate per seconde (but more important you will loose around 10% in melee aggro, which the one that you fell more easily); and for me it\'s a huge loss.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nEDIT : bwt, BoC/GBoS would be an excelent increase both in feeling (big melee aggro boost and big dps boost) and in overall power (little total aggro increase).<br/>\napolyon<br/>\n02-08-2005, 10:13 AM<br/>\nI\'d keep the epic offhand until you can land your epic 1.5. For me the value of the epic 1.0 redblade is in the lore of the item. As far as offhanded, you\'d be hard preseed to buy a weapon that will \"run circles around\" your epic. There are definitly better options available, but the combo you have should suffice. If you can land a nodrop from some random encounters then i\'d swing it ... but I certainly wouldnt buy another weapon to replace epic.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd yes Epic offhanded to BoC.<br/>\nBrutul<br/>\n02-08-2005, 10:39 AM<br/>\nHehe, people were banking warrior epic 1.0s as soon as they got to sleeper\'s tomb, which was halfway through Velious, which was about 5 expansions ago. Personally I wouldn\'t recommend using the red epic for anything at all these days, but if you must use it, then definitely put it in your offhand. If I were you I would put that A3 proc into your GBoS for sure.

There are some decent augs in that zone. Looking back, I tanked Sewers 1-4 at around 7.5k unbuffed (and like 1500 ac). Did vxed/Tipt at about 7.8k unbuffed and 1600 ac. (Not Time-flagged at that point). Once you get to Kod\'Taz, you can take the same grp and do Ikkinz single-group trials. In one of those trials, a shielding aug 2% drops as well as a 46% haste bracer.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for MPG I think you\'d do okay in it, maybe get a backup healer (I still appreciate one when I am there <E>:)</E> ).<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck let us know how it goes.<br/>\nSeraz<br/>\n02-09-2005, 04:37 AM<br/>\nhey sarcazzm,<br/>\nweapon wise you\'re doing great... <br/>\nyour boots, greaves, waist, bp, bracers, gloves, face slots can all do a bit of upgrading...<br/>\n<br/>\nfor the visible slots i strongly suggest getting a full set of armsmaster\'s (minus the legs n bp) they really do give a nice hp/ac boost... <br/>\ngreaves - if you cant wait for Kuann infantry greaves go and get ornate ones or magnetic/charged.<br/>\nwaist- for around 30k you can get a duskwalkers sash (100hp, 18ac, melee stats) and then you could either get tribute haste until MPG where you can possibly get the 36% haste aug...<br/>\nface - if you cant wait for a new mask go get a amygladan\'s chain mask (around 20k) if u can then wait for Maze runners.<br/>\nbreastplate - get kizraks chestplate, it\'ll last you ages...<br/>\ntheres also a named girplan who drops Stone of Resilience (15 ac aug) near cubby.... if you\'re low on cash then camping cubby when it\'s quiet will rack you up some runes to sell for cash... also get a shroud of the fallen defender from Noc Bonecleaver at hill camp... very very good ac click...<br/>\nbtw... one last thing, u might want to start on your epic 1.5... not too difficult and very much worth it..<br/>\n<br/>\ngood luck....<br/>\n<br/>\nConquerer Seraz Serilis<br/>\nBruenorg<br/>\n02-09-2005, 06:55 AM<br/>\nAll the gear suggestions are great but the real difference will come with levels and AAs. While I think MPG would be doable with the right healers (note the plural <E>;)</E>), I wouldn\'t personally recommend it until you get those defensive AAs done at least up to and including LR5/ID5. They really do make a huge difference in your tanking ability...moreso than the extra 50 or so AC and 100-200 HPs you would get from upgrades in the short term. My advice would be to stick with content thats more suited to your tanking level...get level 70 and AAs and then go play in MPG. Otherwise, you might spend more time LOADING PLEASE WAIT... versus making better use of your time grinding out the XPs in places better suited to your gear/level/AAs.<br/>\nAciphex<br/>\n02-09-2005, 03:57 PM<br/>\ngear wise i htink you could take it but your aa\'s are lacking<br/>\n<br/>\nbtw grats on 7k and ur armsmaster stuff<br/>\nSarcazzm<br/>\n02-09-2005, 05:28 PM<br/>\nthanks <E>:)</E><br/>\nSupportTank<br/>\n02-14-2005, 03:37 AM<br/>\nin short no yer ac and hp are too low to tank effectivly in MPG. <br/>\n<br/>\ngood number to shoot for is 8500+ hp unbuffed and 1800 ac. at this point you should be able to start tanking in mpg.<br/>\n<br/>\nwith the release of oow there are more upgrades via tradeskills that are good upgrades for you.<br/>\n<br/>\nbut i will say this. you will be able to tank in OOW more then you will be able to tank in gates. due to the attack power of mobs in gates. they simply hit harder and more consistantly then normal exp mobs in oow.<br/>\n<br/>\nso exp wise oow much easy to tank.<br/>\nElfried<br/>\n02-14-2005, 04:19 AM<br/>\nI was tanking in MPG yesterday and had a very hard time.<br/>\nI have 700HP less then you but 250AC more and about the same Defensive AAs.<br/>\nI usually have 9.3kHP and 1850AC fully buffed incl. tribute.<br/>\nTankability of our chars should be comparable i think.<br/>\nIt is hard but you can do the easy camps with a good group.<br/>\nBetter bring a 2nd healer to patch you until mob is slowed.

But you could do it, and some of the upgrades in MPG are nice for a tank.<br/>\n<br/>\nNot sure how developed your high end is on your server but if you have some friends try to get them to let you know when stuff is rotting in RS like any HP or AC augs, or the Celestial Lorica.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll in all imo your HP aren\'t the big issue its the AC. gotta work that up a bit to flatten out those dmg spike more and you would be a solid reliable tank in MPG.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh and, if you do head in stick to camps like Odi &amp; Tactics, b/c in near body, realms, mind, etc you start to see a boost in max hit on mobs as well as Ramp/Flurry and Attk going up on them (aka they are 1 to 2 levels higher).<br/>\n<br/>\nJust to give you an idea, when OoW came out I think Tam was at 6.9k unbuffed and around 1400 ac much like you.

I just recently got a flurry of upgrades that took me to 8300 unbuffed with no tribute/leadership hit points, but I tanked PG just fine with a good cleric at more like 7500 unbuffed and mid 1600s unbuffed AC. My AC still isn\'t 1800 without buffs. It\'s barely over 1700 with a couple muramite pieces, an elem piece, ldon bp, loyalist shield, etc. That\'s a lot of elem gear to reach 1800 unbuffed/no trib. Of course what buffs are available in your PG group will make a difference. And I wasn\'t in PG at all until I had all defensive up through the 3rd mitigation and avoidance ones in OoW. I have all of them now.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt certainly showed me which clerics were competent. A good one kept me up fine. A bad one would watch me die repeatedly and never adjust their healing tactics. <br/>\n<br/>\nStill haven\'t been able to get maze runner stuff out of PG... very rare at least when i\'m in the zone. :p<br/>\napolyon<br/>\n02-14-2005, 01:24 PM<br/>\nYou could get by ... but you\'d be far far far from an efficient tank.<br/>\n<br/>\nMPG would eat you alive without early slows and a talented healer. If you were 70 with a handful more defensive aa\'s i might change my tune ... or had 1-2k more hps.... or maybe 300 more ac.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut at sub 70 with 1450ac and not very many defensives it\'s gonna be rough.<br/>\nSarcazzm<br/>\n02-14-2005, 06:38 PM<br/>\ni know a SK that tanked it with around 7600hp/1700ac. was using that as my goals<br/>\nTamener<br/>\n02-15-2005, 05:17 AM<br/>\nNot doubting anyone in specific but would just like to say that in the 1500 hp i have gained and closed to 400 AC since I have been tanking MPG, i too thought I tanked it \"just fine\" as many say they do. Looking back I was a suxtank during that period and was usually held up by a solid cleric (RL friend). So for those asking this question now and in the future, you would do better to listen to the folks drawing tangable lines rather then the folks saying \"i\'ve done it with less and i was \'just fine\'\".<br/>\n<br/>\nIn closing this posts let me say I don\'t know how any specific one of you performs in MPG etc. Just saying that in some of the other threads on this topic i have seen some pretty substandard tanks make this claim and some of the most respected tanks on these boards saying something completely different, as always up to you to decide =)<br/>\nArathena<br/>\n02-15-2005, 06:40 AM<br/>\nAs an SK, at level 70, and all defensive AA, I tank adequately in MPG with 6900 / 1770 unbuffed... but there\'s definitely uh-oh moments. My warrior bot, who\'s at about the same HP, 1500ish AC unbuffed, and Base/PoP AAs has a mildly rougher time of it. It can be done, but generally, she\'s better off somewhere else.<br/>\napolyon<br/>\n02-15-2005, 09:15 AM<br/>\nA SK also has the added perk of 100% aggro control 100% of the time, therefore the cleric only has one person\'s hps to worry about. Said SK will also be using a shield or 2hander to cut down on ripostes.<br/>\n<br/>\nI dunno if i was just imagining it or not ... but I always thought the mobs in MPG and RSS riposted an absolute fuckton ... was pretty noticable after slow.<br/>\n<br/>\nYour biggest crutch is just that ac. 1450 will hurt. Without higher ac and defensives count on a lot of max rounds. Off lightnings with a flurry thats over 6k dmg in one round. On some of the nastier proccing mobs like kyvs and nocs its 1k x 4 + bash + a possible double/triple proc for 710 which you won\'t resist with less than 350-400 PR. MPG isn\'t the most difficult xp zone by any stretch and is actually quite nice once yuo reach the gear/aa level to tank it. But under that gear level it\'s really gross. I think i was 8k/1650 unbuffed when i first set foot in there with all defensive aas minus OoW and i got torn to shreads.<br/>\n<br/>\nTam hit the nail on the head. At 8k/1700 and max non-OoW defensives i thought i was the shit. I thought i could do anything. Even at the time i thought I was a solid tank and the zone was just rough.

I agree that you have to think of the augment as being part of the base armor piece. No one will be using this armor without an augment.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe purpose of the augment seems to mainly be a way to keep the religion restrictions on the cultural armor while making things a little easier on the smith. It\'s nice that every piece of armor that I will make can theoretically be used by any member of my race regardless of diety. Will be much easier and cheaper to stock an assortment of symbol augments then to stock separate pieces of armor for each religion, especially the ones that few people pick (like Bristlebane).<br/>\n<br/>\n<URL url=\"http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v67/sertretsin/cult_armor2.jpg\"><LINK_TEXT text=\"http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v67/s ... armor2.jpg\">http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v67/sertretsin/cult_armor2.jpg</LINK_TEXT></URL> <br/>\n<br/>\nThe bracer is clearly subpar compared to the other pieces.

I\'m thinking things like Charged Magnetic BP and Legs, Radiant Cut Kyanite of Pure Haste, etc...

An emp level aggro weapon would be a pretty big step up for CHoS/SoTB wielding people. I\'m not sure that anyone that has a BoC is going to bother with it at 15/19. Hell Hategiver is so easy to get its not even funny.<br/>\nretsin<br/>\n02-13-2005, 01:11 AM<br/>\nAt 20/21 that Axe was enough to turn me into a gibbering puddle of drool.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 15/19 ... meh whatever.<br/>\nSarcazzm<br/>\n02-13-2005, 01:12 AM<br/>\nagreed, any less than 16/19 is kinda pointless except for the innate agro proc, and hell, i could just farm a hategiver and have a ton more AC and *drumroll* a better agro proc.<br/>\n<br/>\nthat weapon , without more ac, stats, or maybe even a minor procratemod, will be pretty pointless for anyone with a BoC+ mainhand. its for the warriors who cant farm the plat or raid for better, not much to dispute there i think.<br/>\nFrostpaw<br/>\n02-13-2005, 01:35 AM<br/>\nFor level 70\'s...The \"high-end\" of groupable weaps seems to be despair at 24/21. The \"low-end\" (attainable by ANY level 70) in my mind would be CHoS at 13/20. Would be nice to see one from these mission vendors thats splits the difference a little better between these two extremes.<br/>\n<br/>\nA 15/19 weap seems a little blah these days---&gt;BoC/GBoS/OSoW/SoMWV/BBC.... seems like there are already a lot of weaps in that general neighborhood. Will still provide an upgrade to some people so thats cool, but to many it will be seen as a very marginal upgrade at best. Anyway, we see what happens when this thing goes live.<br/>\nVaralla<br/>\n02-13-2005, 02:33 AM<br/>\nWeapon is truely superior to the BoC hands down as of now.<br/>\nThere will be a happy warrior in my guild when I get one of these puppies.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy delima will be between the BF and this weapon.<br/>\nAs it currently stands, I cant decide what to main hand<br/>\n<br/>\nRatio and good proc Vs.

Like i said, will be a great upgrade to some, but will be very minimal to a lot of people too.<br/>\nretsin<br/>\n02-13-2005, 03:56 AM<br/>\nI really hope that Zajeer will consider bumpinjg the ratio back up a bit. 20/21 may be a bit overpowered for the ease of getting this but at 15/19 it really isn\'t any better then a BoC (a weapon from roughly 100 expansiona ago) and its clearly inferior to Hategiver.<br/>\n<br/>\nCasual / One Group warriors could really use some love here.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know we have some creative types on this board. I am sure Zajeer would enjoy being the hero of a 10.000 line epic poem, and I am sure we can find a few warriors willing to sing it to all the peoples of Norrath. =)<br/>\nFrodlin7th<br/>\n02-13-2005, 04:27 AM<br/>\nOne of the issues is that the warrior weapon needs to keep in line DPS wise with similar weapons that other classes have on the mission vendors to maintain the 1.0, 1.2, 1.4 ratio. While it\'d be \"nice\" to have more, the others would have to \"have more\" too, and it messes with encounters, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would probably hope that it be higher damage and higher delay while mainting a similar ratio, like 22/28ish, which would have a similar result but which lowers ripostes and allows for power increases with flurry AA\'s to match the power increases of triple backstab AA\'s when wielding similar weaponry. Obviously the idea that it\'s a little worse from a Dmg/Dly/stat perspective than a Tradeskilled long sword from 2 expansions ago isn\'t real thrilling.<br/>\nretsin<br/>\n02-13-2005, 07:18 AM<br/>\nI can understand the need to keep warrior weapons in line with what other classes have available, but looking at the ratio alone doesn\'t tell the whole story. There is a 15/19 sword on the same merchant for the same cost that has an innate 200 DD proc, and a 16/20 mace with a 125 point lifetap. Plus both weapons have an empty type 4 slot to toss another big DD aug into. We warriors get a weapon with the same ratio, but with a proc that produces no damage and most of us are going to throw an augment on it that is likewise pure hate. Bumping up the ratio a little bit would help compensate for the damage procs.<br/>\n<br/>\nI\'m still thinking the epic poem is the solution.<br/>\nCily<br/>\n02-13-2005, 07:45 AM<br/>\nConsidering you can get 16/19 and 17/20 weapons from LDoN this weapon would be pretty unimpressive at 15/19<br/>\n<br/>\nGranted the stats are much better and you get another proc, the net result is still that you lose DPS, thus the 1.0, 1.2, 1.4 model is ignored anyhow (not that the model is really accurate anyway, heh)<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe it will have a type 6 slot, or some other slot for a +dmg aug. Working to make it 17/19 makes it immediately desireable to lots of people, even those up to LSotBK and such.<br/>\n<br/>\nFYI, I have to speculate that there will be a rogue dagger that is at least slightly superior to MDoD (16/19). A warrior DWing 15/19\'s is not going to be 70-75% of a rogue weilding (the presumably out dated) MDoD + any multitude of 1.25ish ratio offhanders<br/>\n<br/>\nI know, I know. A bunch of warriors are gonna say \"but I arent made for da DPS, RAWR\". I dont care, I am responding to the model, and personally... I am 2nd highest DPS in my XP groups, not going to gimp my XP rate so I can weild 190% more agro then I need.<br/>\n<br/>\nCily<br/>\nBrutul<br/>\n02-13-2005, 11:02 AM<br/>\nCurrently the item has been changed to 15/19 ratio. Other stats stayed pretty much the same. I would not say it blows BOC away anymore.<br/>\n<br/>\nYeah that is a bigger reduction that I was imagining. Looks like Ssra weapons are still the best 1-hand aggro weapons till time+ raids. I would use this thing over a BoC, but if I had a BoC already I don\'t know if I would bother. Slightly better ratio/stats but with 100 less hate on the proc isn\'t much of an upgrade.<br/>\nVenkmen<br/>\n02-13-2005, 12:11 PM<br/>\nI agree that this tuning might have been a bit bit to far down. I am thinking along the lines of Frodlin on this one. 19/26 to 20/28 or something of the like would be perfect I think. I for one would not replace my BF with this, but if I were still sporting the BoC I \"MIGHT\" think about replacing that and seling it for cash to upgrade other slots. <br/>\n<br/>\nFor the group of people that this weapon is aimed at it seems to be close to in line.<br/>\napolyon<br/>\n02-13-2005, 01:08 PM<br/>\nThe ratio could stand to be better than it presently is. Optimally i would petition to have it raised to 17/20 or 18/20. Basically you\'re stepping up to a ratio which is buyable from OoW ... comparable stats but with an innate aggro proc. Granite Scepter of Cruelty anyone?<br/>\n<br/>\n20/21 might have been a bit overpowering, but 15/19 is a joke. From an aggro standpoint might want to change the innate proc to EB as well if you\'re not going to provide warriors with a solid ratio.<br/>\n<br/>\nWill BoC be the end-all for the non-raider (and by non raider i imply semi-casual as well)?

So if your friends are evil and you are good, you can do an evil mission with them and just not turn in the token to avoid a +evil -good faction hit. You get the shards either way. The shards are also tradeable, so if you can find an evil person that has some good shards you can trade them straight across. I don\'t know how difficult it would be to switch factions to get 2x enraging blow procs or whatever.

LDoN is dead (ok, it was mostly dead already). Tier 1 OoW quests? Why? Ornate armor? Heh. Elemental armor? eh, maybe. At least for tanks it has an AC advantage and hit points at least to start with, though the new armor has more aug slots so might top out at higher hit points. But why go through the huge number of raids needed to outfit your regulars with elem armor when you can just do single group missions and be able to pick out the exact pieces each person needs the most? Well, hope the missions are at least fairly difficult. If the mobs are only hitting for 500 or so it\'s going to be a joke to get outfitted.

But well, since DoN will be out soon, I think the problem won\'t exsit at all.<br/>\nVelle<br/>\n02-13-2005, 08:02 AM<br/>\nNorge\'Tal !!<br/>\n<br/>\nNorge`Tal is the winner.

And I don\'t carry any arrows either. The bow is purely for the stats.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was wondering, why is the Frostbringer better at agro than the Flesgrinder. THe frostbringer is less ratio, and still a DD proc. I\'ve always been told that proc\'s aside, better ratio = better agro. <br/>\n<br/>\nI was also told that with WA5 and Anger Augs, the Dain\'s axe would be useless compared to my much faster Fleshgrinders.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd to that Norge Tal guy.

The Axeman 1N is my favorite Mech. It is a 65 Ton mech. I supposed I don\'t need to stay lvl 65, but it seemed fitting for me to play a 65 Axemann in EQ. My biggest problem is I started playin eq before BER\'s were a class.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn all seriousness, I probably will eventually lvl to 70. ATM I don\'t plan on it cause it\'s easier to limit my horizon so as to make it seem attainable. If I plan on getting 70, and 12k HP, the task would seem quite overwelming. Planning on getting 65, with 6.5k HP is much easier.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think Once I get my Agro management in order, I should be able to lvl quite easily. But as it stands, I can\'t even go LFG. For every group I get to expects me to hold agro. Since I can\'t do that, All I can do is grind AA\'s, in hopes of getting WA5, and allowing my Frostbringer to do it\'s job.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the mean time I work on my SHM, just to solo stuff to sell to support my WAR\'s gear.<br/>\nSarcazzm<br/>\n03-09-2005, 10:51 PM<br/>\nhey cool i didnt know you were talking about teh BattleTech Axeman <E>:)</E> i personally liked the Stormcrow and Maurader but to each his own <E>:)</E><br/>\n<br/>\nI totally understand you wanting to have modest goals, but really, if you level to 70 and burn through the 25 sturdiness aa\'s, youll be around 6k unbuffed. with the gear easily attainable by a group of 70\'s, its not hard to hit 7k+, thats the only real reason i\'d level either, i fucking hate the grind <E>:)</E><br/>\nBrutacus<br/>\n03-10-2005, 11:44 AM<br/>\nHow about lvl 65 grind off defensive aa\'s for a while, maybe the Axeman a1 will get a 5 ton weapon upgrade in the meantime.<br/>\nAxeman1n<br/>\n03-11-2005, 09:28 AM<br/>\nhey cool i didnt know you were talking about teh BattleTech Axeman <E>:)</E> i personally liked the Stormcrow and Maurader but to each his own <E>:)</E><br/>\n<br/>\nI totally understand you wanting to have modest goals, but really, if you level to 70 and burn through the 25 sturdiness aa\'s, youll be around 6k unbuffed. with the gear easily attainable by a group of 70\'s, its not hard to hit 7k+, thats the only real reason i\'d level either, i fucking hate the grind <E>:)</E><br/>\n<br/>\nThe only stormcrow worth fielding is B. It\'s got 6 ER Medium\'s and an Ultra AC 20. There are way too many Marauder\'s to think about. There are MAD, MAD IIC, and MAD II C, and MAD C. Each with their own individual variants. My Fave has 2 ERPPC\'s and a Gauss Rifle. <br/>\n<br/>\nNow to tie this tangent back to the game.... The Catapult, another mech I love, has weapons that when added to a certain popular variant of the Marauder are identical to the weapons of the Timberwolf. So when naming that mech, they called it, Marauder Catapult... or MADCAT for short. My first EQ toon ever was named Timbrewolf. A Vah Shir SHM. I thought it would be funny to call myself wolf, knowing that the Innersphere Name was Madcat, thus completing the hidden humor as a cat race. However, when I got my own account, I couldn\'t afford the transfer fee, so I remade him. With that name already taken, I took the less funny name of Maddcat. <br/>\n<br/>\nnow back to reason. ATM I am grinding out some aa\'s, to get better agro. I assume that I\'ll have better agro with the WA5 aa\'s. So that\'s my current goal. After I get that, I\'ll lvl to 65, and start to grind more AA\'s to flesh out my Defense. I personally believe that i have plenty of HP for the Game Content I\'m doing (Pre Gates) So agro is really my only concern.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am also trying to get that bloodfields agro aug in the mean time.

There are two reasons I wouldn\'t sweat it.<br/>\nFirst, as you no doubt noticed on your main, levels come more slowly as you go along, giving you longer to gain skill. My guess is that most warriors don\'t get all their skills up for some time. <br/>\nSecond, your skill will help determine the actual damage you do to mobs, but it will not, as far as I could tell, have an effect on the aggro you generate. So, if you do fall a bit behind on a skill and later get a good 1hb, you\'ll hold aggro with it at a skill level of 150 just as well as you would with a skill level of, say, 230.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for Ac, recomendations would be based on what you\'re wearing now, and i don\'t know that. If you\'re really lightly armored, you can look at<br/>\ncrafted<br/>\ncrusty<br/>\nSandblasted/frosted etc<br/>\n<br/>\nA bit better lines of armor than that include<br/>\nbarbed ringmail (gloves are 19 AC, legs 25 AC etc)<br/>\n<br/>\nBut that\'s just general info, and more or less based on the idea you have little or no plat. You can start to notice certain patterns if you search by class/race/religion and by AC and your budget in the bazaar, because there are all sorts of bits of armor floating around out there (Hmmm, crested spaulders...mithral torque, etc) that might work for you.<br/>\nIf you have armor that\'s about equivalent to barbed ringmail\'s stats, I wouldn\'t bother upgrading, but would instead focus on continuing to have a good time, and leveling.<br/>\nIf you picked a religion for your ogre, you have some pretty good cultural options, but no need to get too worried about how to get them for a while.<br/>\nIf you post a magelo, suggestions would be far more precise.<br/>\nAnd if you\'re level 30, I think you just got the ability to /shield.

It\'s never hurt me to spend time helping guildies with the odd quest/camp/farming.

I have this feeling that because we\'re so close to new gear that we\'ll get like 6 DB in the next couple of weeks or something terribly ironic like that.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo the question: How rare is BBoB and should I continue to wait or is it not worth trying to?

I\'ll be adding one more Valorium Ring of Gallantry and 2 Electrified Earrings of Tempest. That will bring my hp to about 4150 and ac to 1275. I have the Corroded Plate Guants and Helm, but I don\'t think I\'ll finish the quest for the helm. I have playing with Magelo to see what Warlord\'s does for me, since we\'ll looking that direction in the not-too-far future.<br/>\n<br/>\nI noticed that when I threw in some pieces of Warlord\'s gear, such as the helm, legs, and boots, that my ac rose but my hp dropped (since Helanic has such nice hp on it).<br/>\n<br/>\nSo my question is, should I take the 200hp hit from Warlord\'s and get the extra 20ish ac? My guild does not raid PoP yet, I am the guild MT, but I do hunt in PoP a lot for xp and AA.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne thing I considered was keeping my Helanic gear for pre-PoP raids and then throw the Warlord\'s stuff on for PoP hunting. But it would be a pain in the arse to carry it around, or bank it and have to make frequent visits to the bank.<br/>\n<br/>\nDiscuss...<br/>\nSanori<br/>\n04-22-2003, 09:31 AM<br/>\nLet me rephrase...<br/>\n<br/>\nI would obviously swap out the Helanic guants for the Myrmidon Guants, and the Helanic BP for the Warlord\'s BP because they are clear upgrades. But the rest of the stuff is a trade off of hp for ac...<br/>\nJysin<br/>\n04-22-2003, 10:06 AM<br/>\nAs it stands, I wouldnt trade off your hitpoints for AC. If your guild dosent touch anything, and specifically if you dont MT raids in PoP, I wouldnt ditch 200hp for 20ac. Thats pretty harsh regardless which expantion youre playing on.<br/>\n<br/>\nKeeping in mind that in PoP the returns for AC are much greater, you can start now by keeping in mind what items you go in bids / rolls for. Make sure its a nice balance of AC and HP. You dont want to fall short in either one.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope this helps.<br/>\nShikarii<br/>\n04-22-2003, 10:10 AM<br/>\n1275AC and 4K+ hp\'s at 60 isn\'t nothing to sneeze at..i can\'t open magelo\'s here; so i am wondering what/how many aa\'s you have..<br/>\nusually it\'s a tradeoff for 1AC=10 hp\'s; but it\'s almost an even trade for you; so i\'d stay with the more hit points and get 61 with the planar durability ( i think it\'s called that so you can go over 255 in stats ) and than try out the armours again in your pofiles to see if you\'re past the 255 stamina cap with the warlords gear.<br/>\nSanori<br/>\n04-22-2003, 12:21 PM<br/>\nShikarii I have 18 AAs - RS3, Regen3, and ND3.<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess my mode of thought is that the 20ac I\'ll get by adding Warlord\'s to my profile will not mitigate enough damage in PoP xp grinds to make up for the 200ish hp I would lose.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn addition, I would rather spend the time it would take me to get to ally with giants, by doing AAs and getting CA3 and CS3. I am betting the mitigation from CA3 and CS3 would blow 20ac out of the water.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd lastly, in PoP groups I tend to find my stats being mostly maxed by buffs already - especially strength and stamina. Once I add my Myrmidon BP, I am not sure the 5ac upgrade on the Warlord BP would be worth the hours spent factioning.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf there\'s any difference of opinion...please do post.<br/>\nShikarii<br/>\n04-22-2003, 12:55 PM<br/>\nmost of my guildmates have scattered pieces of myrmi/warlords/cultural...i think you\'re best bet (although time consuming) is to just keep plugging your magelo account with the pieces and see how it pans out )<br/>\n<br/>\noverall from what i remember; most of my guildmates have myrmi gloves, warlords arms and legs and maybe helm; bracers are usually the BoB or cultural ones..but i\'d stick with your gear now since it sounds like losing the 200 hp\'s will hurt you more than gaining 20AC; and your next few AA\'s will definately help out your hit point level your at now.<br/>\n<br/>\nmy guess would be start getting the next level of items ( vindi or statue BP ); and depending on guild progress start some ST keying or if you\'re still on CoV faction go smack up Dozer if it\'s an option on your server. We wer e fortunate to have Dozer available to us and the benefits of the quest items there are still worth hanging on to in terms of what we fight ( just about halfway ready for VT )<br/>\nFriedrick<br/>\n04-22-2003, 02:52 PM<br/>\nPersonally I would do the Warlord\'s helm and gloves if you get them. I would not do the boots or legs, they don\'t have the hps as you already know that your current ones do. But, the Gloves and Helm would be upgrades both HP and AC wise. Unless I missed something in your Magelo, your stamina was only like 167 so you have quite a ways to go to max it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would exp in WW personally to kill the faction/exp birds with one stone. Honestly the factioning for Kael wasn\'t that bad. I did it in a week or so killing in SS to get my Warlord\'s BP. Killing green mobs sucked but it beat continuing with my Indicolite BP. All you need is to get non Kos to Kromzek, then turn in Dwarf heads or Kobold paws. I was still kos to Rif and Tmax when I did my turn in. The train leaving was very memorable, LOL.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou may consider a Helanic Tundra Cloak as well. Very nice cloaks as you would trade off 6 AC or so for some very nice HPs. Your AC is quite good for your level and gear and you probably wouldn\'t miss a few here or there for the right HP upgrade. I would wear one but I have shroud of the Dar Brood so I don\'t want to give up the haste. I wear the belt instead <E>:)</E><br/>\n<br/>\nFriedrick - 63rd Warlord on Tunare Server<br/>\nSanori<br/>\n04-22-2003, 04:37 PM<br/>\nFriedrich thanks for the input.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was actually in the process of having a Helanic cloak made but chose to go with the Lodi Shield for the resists.

All the time I see people piling on STA gear when it doesn\'t help anything besides your Magelo. You\'ll get a 60 STA buff on a raid or some exp groups, use it to your advantage.<br/>\n<br/>\nRaw HP &gt; AC &gt; STA<br/>\nCallon<br/>\n04-25-2003, 12:19 PM<br/>\nThe old wisdom was something like 10 hp = 1 AC if you\'re below the pre PoP AC softcap (roughly 1260) on your average hunts. Parses in PoP have showed a higher or nonexistent cap to AC, but gains from it that don\'t justify 10hp for every AC. Based on what I\'ve seen on the boards and my own experience, I\'m using around 4-5hp = 1 raw AC to judge gear. I know some people value AC even less than that. <br/>\n<br/>\nYou might keep the 1260 figure in mind for hunting older zones if you\'re below it but it doesn\'t look like you have much trouble with that, especially if you add some buffs.<br/>\nEmiliaEQ<br/>\n04-26-2003, 03:03 AM<br/>\nIts relative.... <br/>\nFor non PoP HP = King<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for PoP<br/>\nA few parses have showed that +100ac is 2% less dps taken.<br/>\n(Check the threads, numbers arent totally exact but they seem ok)<br/>\nThus 100ac will give you 2% more hp (since you\'ll take 2% less dmg)<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is a very blunt formula :<br/>\n<br/>\n1200ac 6000hp +100ac = 2% more hp = 120hp virtually gained<br/>\nSo 1300 6000 = 1200 6120<br/>\n<br/>\n1400ac 8000hp +100ac = 2% more hp = 160hp virtually gained<br/>\nSo 1500 8000 = 1400 8160<br/>\n<br/>\nFor me atm :<br/>\n1800ac 9600hp +100ac = 2% more hp = 192 hp virtually gained<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter some point it is insanely hard to raise your HP.<br/>\nRaising ac is still relatively easy and will give you more benefit.<br/>\n<br/>\nBtw : Call of the Rathe is your friend.

I can\'t tell you how awesome this is, it\'s the best item I have ever bought for my warrior.<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess I am set for weapons so I can start saving for a BoC.<br/>\nGear<br/>\n05-03-2003, 05:19 PM<br/>\nGreatstaff of Thunder = Crackstick!<br/>\n<br/>\nIm addicted to my Greatstaff of Thunder!<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I bought it I had no idea what it looked like I just like the stats. I knew I need someting a little faster than a Windblade and the fact that it had a proc was just a bonus. After I bought it I equiped it then hit F9 and quickly crapped my pants! This thing looks weird as hell. It doesnt look like what you would think a 2 hand blunt weapon would look like. It certainly doesnt look like the staff for the icon. I quickly headed to PoN to group up and try this thing out. Now remember this is a 2HB weapon. I had a skill level of \"1\"! The very first thing I noticed is that it sounded like a piercing weapon. I hit F9 and it looks like Im piercing. I expected myself to be wacking the bad guys not pokeing them. Then it proc\'d. The proc looks exactly like the SK/Necro spell Fear with the little green skulls floating around. The very next thing I noticed was that I was tanking mobs that conned red to me with a skill level of \"1\". This weapon is just wacky and I firmly believe whoever designed it was smoking crack! Crack is good, game designers need to smoke more crack!<br/>\n<br/>\nFinally an excellent agro/dps dropable weapon that the average player can obtain that is just plain fun to use.

The staff is a great weapon. the DPS is so-so, but the agro is insane. I can actually keep agro in groups no problem, even against my friend with his staff of flowing water. It is truly a great weapon. Buy it and keep it because it rocks ass.<br/>\nGrendonbb<br/>\n05-05-2003, 12:37 AM<br/>\nGlad everyone caught onto this... I gotta agree with everyone else. Last time I was in steelwarrior serverwide chat and someone asked for a good agro weapon... I linked it, and everyone scoffed.<br/>\n<br/>\nGlad to see things have changed <E>:D</E> This weapon is incredibly underpriced (at least on my server, goes for 25kish) for the amount of agro/dps it produces.

Here\'s how I see aggro, purely from an \"it feels like it\" perspective, because I\'ve given up on parsing for the time being:<br/>\nGreat Staff of Thunder -- Great aggro, if a bit spotty at times against even/yellow/red con mobs. I\'ve heard from other people that the proc\'s small knockback can be a detriment, but I\'ve not noticed a problem with it.<br/>\nWar Marshall\'s Bladed Staff -- No proc, but a great ratio in a fast tradeable weapon makes this one a winner. It\'s one for reliable get-and-keep aggro operations. This one is still my favorite all-around 2-hander (yes, there are better out there and, no, I can\'t get some of the uber no-drop stuff just yet, not enough DKP <E>;)</E> ).<br/>\nMy 1-handers (Switfblade of Zek, Frostbringer, Spiked Velium Mallet, Sebilite Croaking Dirk) -- I call this my \"keeping the skills up\" weapons because, except in a few special situations, they don\'t hold a candle for aggro to the Greatstaff or the War Marshall\'s Staff. Still, they aggro better than the Windblade, at least for gaining initial aggro and on short fights.<br/>\nWindblade -- AWESOME damage, but kind of slow and hard to gain aggro with it. The longer the fight lasts the better your chances, though, because it really piles on the DPS. I keep this one around for when I\'m not MT/MA in raids.<br/>\nThese are the personal observations of a level 57 warrior with very few useful AA\'s (I keep telling myself I\'ll get AA when I reach 60....we\'ll see) and not all tanking situations are the same, so your mileage may vary.<br/>\nHyardgune<br/>\n05-08-2003, 10:51 AM<br/>\nPicked up a GoT yesterday for 16.5k (absolute steal) and damn, it is nasty! I still got benched in an xp group in favor of a 63 SK because the chanter was too lazy to let me build aggro. After the SK left, we got another 64 warrior who was dual wielding. Before I logged I pulled out the GoT again just to see what I could do and the poor dude simply could not get aggro off me.<br/>\n<br/>\nI\'m looking forward to using this more often. I\'ve banked or sold all my one handers.<br/>\nwandor<br/>\n05-08-2003, 01:38 PM<br/>\nI almost exclusively group with my wizard and my higher level friends, but last night I wasn\'t in the mood to 2-box so I decided to go LFG on my warrior. I got in a group with a 61 war who had been tanking for the group for some time. He was dual weilding, they where PoP or LoY era weapons because I did not recognize them. He seemed to hold agro well enough that the shaman was not taking a beating when he slowed pretty early. At least one of the weapons had a proc, not sure what it was, but I did see an emote mob_34 staggers.<br/>\n<br/>\nI started with my DW set up - SBoZ+HoH. With CoF+50% shammy haste I was able to crank out DPS at will. No problems at all pulling agro.<br/>\n<br/>\nI switched to Windblade to crank up the DPS a little. Again not too much of a problem. I did pull agro a few times when I would get a string of big hits, but it was easy enough to drop agro by turning off attack.<br/>\n<br/>\nFinally, I busted out the GST. I was not entirely surprised but the effect was even more pronounce that I anticipated. I pulled agro early and often. I would often have to turn attack off for long periods of time to lose agro - upwards of 10-15 seconds. Backing away from the mob only made the mob follow me. The proc generared neck snapping agro - without fail the mob would turn to me on every proc. With the 56 shaman buffs I had on I had 200+ DEX so the GST was procing like a mofo. After a few mobs I had to bag the weapon because I was taking agro too much agro.<br/>\n<br/>\nBuying a GST has been the best purchase I have ever made, truly worth its weight in platinum.<br/>\nproteg<br/>\n05-09-2003, 04:25 PM<br/>\nI was pulling aggro last night off an SK with GST and i was attacking late and staying at max melee range. He was chain casting to keep aggro. I admittedly loved the fact that he was getting his ego severly bruised after bragging to a lot of people that NO ONE ever gets aggro off him. <br/>\n<br/>\nI am really believing that this weapon is the reason why Verant claims that they are happy with the class balance for Tanks. At this point the only time I need to use Taunt is when the slower likes to land slow early. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe best part is that the dps alone keeps me close enough to the top of the hate list that if slow pulls aggro off of me, a single Taunt gets it back 99% of the time. The rest of the 1% of the time if it procs before Taunt refreshes, aggro is mine anyways. <br/>\n<br/>\nI used this in BoT with a Hunter GAR and two 65 Marauder Rogues. Absolutely no isues with maintaining aggro after slow. (or holding it through slow either really as mentioned above <E>:)</E><br/>\n<br/>\nSo all warriors who can get this need to get one and let a Pally or SK MT and pull aggro off of them ALL the time. Start demonstrating to whoever has been whining about warriors holding aggro that Warriors can take care of business. <br/>\n<br/>\nThere is, however, a VERY important caveat. You better have good armor. Cause in most pulls the mob is going to be locked on to you ALL the time. You won\'t get that 4 second respite while the mob runs over to the Shaman to slap him silly for slowing him that will allow the cleric to pump a CH. You will get beat down. <br/>\n<br/>\nWith enough hps and AC though your group will love you.<br/>\nSarelin<br/>\n05-09-2003, 10:21 PM<br/>\nGot a Norge`Tal yesterday! OMG!<br/>\n<br/>\nFor mobs where the proc on it is not resisted its fantastic. Need to be at a decent haste level though ideally since its a bit slow. <br/>\n<br/>\nGiven that you are at 100% or more though it has the aggro of the Greatstaff with the dps of the Warmashall\'s bladed staff.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt really came into its own last night just crawling through Hate\'s Fury with no cleric. Some fights the mobs never got to hit me as I chained 6 second stuns!<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course now I have to keep all 3 on me. Most PoP mobs resist the Norge`Tal, so the greatstaff is still very useful against casters there and if I am not MT I\'ll use the Warmarshall\'s still to stop myself ripping aggro onto myself.</r>','e16064b2d6e846b6e5af995e9127172b',0,'','pwpywrad',1,0,'',0,0,0,1,0,'',0),(42,42,36,2,0,'50.25.122.79',1506261574,0,1,1,1,1,'','Windblade vs. War Marshall\'s bladed staff','<r>The Steel Warrior &gt; The Steel Warrior - EverQuest &gt; The Bunker &gt; Windblade vs. War Marshall\'s bladed staff<br/>\nPDA<br/>\nView Full Version : Windblade vs. War Marshall\'s bladed staff<br/>\n<br/>\nCallon<br/>\n04-24-2003, 03:07 AM<br/>\nWhich weapon would be better for a warrior? They\'re both very close. <br/>\n<br/>\nWindblade is 50/44, ac15 +12 dex/sta, +35hp. <br/>\n<br/>\nWar Marshall\'s Bladed Staff is 31/28, +9 dex/sta/agi, +50hp +5 svp/d<br/>\n<br/>\nStrictly by ratio, the windblade is 2.6% better. However at L63, Windblade has a dmg bonus of 41 and the staff has a bonus of 31. I noticed that the dmg bonus doesn\'t scale up as fast as the delay. If you increased bladed staff delay from 28 to 44 and made the dmg bonus increase by the same percentage from 31, it would be almost 49. So you\'re going to get a bit more dps from bonus dmg than you would with windblade. Thus by my estimation they\'re almost dead even on damage output. <br/>\n<br/>\nOther factors -- windblade yields just a few more hit points if your stamina isn\'t maxed, and mine isn\'t, but it\'s just a few. Mainly it has 15 AC to the staff\'s zero. I like AC. I\'m usually the guy taking the damage. On the other hand, the bladed staff is faster delay, so I\'m guessing it would taunt better. So what would the preference of experienced warriors out there be? Is the taunt significantly better with a 28 delay 2 hander over windblade?<br/>\nSpinetwist<br/>\n04-24-2003, 03:50 AM<br/>\nWar Marshalls imo. Had that thing and loved the dmg<br/>\nGear<br/>\n04-24-2003, 12:09 PM<br/>\nDoesnt the same damage with fewer swings = less reposts make the Windbalde the winner? <E>:o</E><br/>\nNevian<br/>\n04-24-2003, 01:16 PM<br/>\nTried out both at one point and honestly didn\'t notice much of a difference. Both are nice weapons. I didn\'t parse it but i couldn\'t tell a big difference in either aggro or damage. Either is a great 2hander.<br/>\n<br/>\nedit~repost damage in PoP has been tuned way down (stealth nerf?), extra damage from repost while DW now is close to the same as 2h. duel wielded all night in inner pov and asked the cleric (RL friend) to watch my health and compare how much mana he was using. said he noticed no difference from my normall 2h setup over 4 hours.<br/>\nBaadan<br/>\n04-24-2003, 04:37 PM<br/>\nGreatstaff of Thunder &gt; both<br/>\nCallon<br/>\n04-24-2003, 11:50 PM<br/>\nheh... but I don\'t HAVE a greatstaff of thunder and have yet to see one for sale. I have a windblade. We got a war marshall\'s staff recently, and a ranger friend is going to get either the windblade or the staff depending on which one I use. As I said, I think their dps is almost identical. It\'s just a question of whether the faster speed on the staff helps with taunt much and is enough to give up the AC on the windblade. My AC is pretty low as it is. It\'s above the old pre PoP 1260 soft cap, but pretty low by PoP standards.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, the ranger is a friend of mine so I\'ll probably just try the staff and trade back weapons if I don\'t notice much taunt difference. We think dps is about the same, but I want aggro and the ranger doesn\'t. Point for windblade... 50 dmg means those crits and crips are more impressive looking! <E>:)</E><br/>\n<br/>\np.s. actually i think the staff is about 1% more dmg. heh... pretty insignificant, though in a game where you can spend 18 AA points to get a double riposte on half of your ripostes... i think that amounts to about a 2% dmg increase for 18 AA... /shudder<br/>\nDobbo Baggins<br/>\n04-24-2003, 11:52 PM<br/>\ni like quicker weapons for tanking below 45 range i dunno just a thing. so i\'d choose staff but windblade is nice for pure dps and the big monster crits to brag about.<br/>\nSarelin<br/>\n04-25-2003, 12:21 PM<br/>\nMy own thoughts are that the best indicator of which is best is the modal hit/delay. <br/>\n<br/>\nFor me the modal hit on the Windblade is 145 and Marshall\'s would be 97.<br/>\n<br/>\n145/44 = 3.30<br/>\n97/28 = 3.46<br/>\n<br/>\nSo the Staff should be better.<br/>\n<br/>\nI own a Greatstaff of Thunder too but sometimes that\'s just too much aggro for raids when not MT. Currently have a Windblade bagged for that, but there\'s a Marshall\'s staff on sale right now and I want it!<br/>\nBaadan<br/>\n04-25-2003, 04:09 PM<br/>\nwhere the **** did those numbers come from?<br/>\nMokor<br/>\n04-25-2003, 04:25 PM<br/>\ntheir so close keep both. need dps go staff. need ac hp go WB use the wb on fellstike, furious, evade, and defence. staff on charge, mighty, and aggressive<br/>\nEstebar<br/>\n04-25-2003, 05:00 PM<br/>\nI used to have a windblade, but I switched it out for the bladed staff. I had both for a while, so I did test between the two and found I liked the staff better.<br/>\n<br/>\nNote, this was before the big hit aggro bug and fix, so I don\'t know if anything changed after they fixed it.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I know I\'m going defensive, I usually use dw.<br/>\nThornyEQ<br/>\n04-25-2003, 08:58 PM<br/>\nI use the WMBS for when I\'m tanking (i.e.: exp group), and the Windblade for when I\'m one of many damage-dealers (i.e.: raids). For aggro purposes, the WMBS just grabs and holds aggro better than the windblade.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt\'s possible that the Great Staff of Thunder will beat both for aggro (although the ratio isn\'t quite as good as the WMBS), but if I can get close without having to rely on a proc that pushes the mob around, all the better for my situation.<br/>\n<br/>\nYMMV.<br/>\nSarelin<br/>\n04-25-2003, 10:33 PM<br/>\nSimple maths Badaan. The damage distribution of a specific weapon is formulaic and if you look at it in any detail you\'ll see that the modal damage, 2*base+bonus, is a most useful figure. Your various hits are a distribution around that number. The modal damage/delay gives you your dps \"comparison number\" for evaluating different 2h weapons. If you wanna do some maths and disprove that then go ahead...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI have all three of those weapons now, Marshalls, Greatstaff and Windblade. Marshalls definately more reliable dps than Windblade but Greatstaff better for aggro on average.<br/>\nBaadan<br/>\n04-25-2003, 11:47 PM<br/>\nOh ok.. so that makes the GoT 98/30, which is 3.27.<br/>\n<br/>\nEven though the DPS is inferior, the proc I feel makes up for it. <br/>\nJust today I was getting aggro 50/50 from a 61 war with red epic and some claw that I can\'t recall the name of, but apparently it was good enough to offhand the epic for, he was in NToV gear if that helps anyone figure out what it was...<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyhoo, GoT rules!

Gonna use the kunzar then when it<br/>\nprocs switch to the polished obsidian for fear. Then after that<br/>\nbust out the DPS weapons and tear the mob up.<br/>\n<br/>\n#2 Invest all my money into DPS weapons &amp; armor--<br/>\n<br/>\nBasically just get a good haste item, good DPS weapons,<br/>\nand better armor to increase my AC and HP (possibly<br/>\nsome regen BP in there somewhere). Then just hope to <br/>\nbeat the tar out of what I\'m fighting.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThis was pretty much all I could think of that would let a warr solo.

THx!<br/>\nShikarii<br/>\n05-12-2003, 11:51 AM<br/>\n#2, fungi tunic and trunch of doom and prob a bandage machine or knife..all depends what you own now.<br/>\n<br/>\nwarrs can solo; just takes a metric f**kload of gear + util\'s to do it.<br/>\nSuperchum<br/>\n05-12-2003, 12:24 PM<br/>\nTo add to what Shik said ... think about perhaps a Windblade to switch to once your Truncheon of Doom procs (BTW, ToD is an absolute must have for soloing purposes at those levels) ... think about perhaps an invigorate casting BP to use in downtime ... and try and get as much utility as you can get.<br/>\n<br/>\nThings like a really fast horse or JBoots or SoW potions or Run 3. They will help you escape when things go REALLY bad.<br/>\n<br/>\nThings like snare weapons, and the slow procs and stuff like DD procs to increase the damage you do and give you an edge.<br/>\n<br/>\nSelf buff clickies. Self heal clickies. Self haste clicky like the eyepatch of plunder.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll of these things will help the warrior solo.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd remember, soloing as a warrior is slow and boring. It\'s definitely possible, it\'s just slow and boring.<br/>\nGriglon<br/>\n05-12-2003, 02:16 PM<br/>\nI definitely agree with the utility weapons comments. A ToD is a MUST if you intend to solo. I spend some time in Velks soloing spiders that way. Get them slowed with ToD then dig out my Windblade to finish them off as fast as possible. I used my bind wound to get past the 201 skill and when I got my BP from SS, that made it all the easier. I don\'t solo too often, but that is where I spend most of my time. Hope that gives you an idea.<br/>\nGaylon<br/>\n05-12-2003, 02:52 PM<br/>\nWhen my usual group-mates are not on, I have been soloing some in PoJ mostly for AA. Sure its not the fastest AA in the world but its better than nothing. As everyone else has said, TOD is a must. If I don\'t get a ToD proc within first 30-40% of mobs life it usually means I have to take the death or train <E>:(</E> <br/>\n<br/>\nI don\'t have any other weapons with anykind of \"utility\" proc. I do have a heal BP which helps with downtime. <br/>\n<br/>\nFor me Warrior soloing is just something to keep myself occupied while I wait for my friends to log on. Its just not efficient/reliable enough to do as a means of actual progression.<br/>\nSmakz<br/>\n05-12-2003, 07:06 PM<br/>\nTruncheon of Doom ... MUST HAVE for a soloing warrior<br/>\n<br/>\nSoW pots or Jboots ... sometimes its better to run away<br/>\n<br/>\nClick buffs ...

I took way way too long to get mine, and after i did I couldn\'t believe I\'d gone so long without it. And I\'d look into a Spiked Sonic Wolf Collar (<URL url=\"http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=2599\">http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=2599</URL>). Should be campable by you solo easily in Hollowshade. Assuming the sonic wolves are up. Just hug the right coming out of Paludal to the tents, Scarflank is in the one closest to the wall. Kill him a bunch and it will drop eventually. 10min respawn.<br/>\nShikarii<br/>\n05-23-2003, 07:07 AM<br/>\nincarnadine BP is teh win. such a nice item ( wished i had one myself back than ).<br/>\ni hated keeping slots for invis potions.<br/>\nBraeorn<br/>\n05-23-2003, 07:26 AM<br/>\nPretty good list...but it depends really on lvl and what your role normally is (xp grind or raid MT)<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as incard BP, sure its nice for clickie, but only if you kill king and get to loot IMO. This is especially true if you are getting thurg anyway cause its not like you\'ll wear it. Instead I just buy larrikan masks (10 charge) for about 150p each...I rarely have to use invis.<br/>\n<br/>\nBraeorn Battlekrye<br/>\n64th Warrior<br/>\nPovar<br/>\nHussar<br/>\n05-23-2003, 07:36 AM<br/>\nI don\'t go a day without using my incarnadine bp, it is so incredably useful. Add in the fact that gather shadows seems to last a lot longer than \"invisibility\". Of course, I also keep 2 invis potions on me, in case I need instant invis.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you\'re buying MQ\'s, try to get SS plate gaunts, those are some of the best gloves you will ever see.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne other thing, I like to keep a tash stick on me, though I don\'t use it much, it\'s cheap and can help if you need your ToD to proc on a high mr mob.<br/>\nFriedrick<br/>\n05-23-2003, 07:47 AM<br/>\nYou obviously have a lot of cash to play with. Therefor I would look at Skyshrine MQ\'s of guants and BP. The guants from SS blow away the Thurg ones and you should be able to afford it.<br/>\nBrudal the Fat<br/>\n05-23-2003, 08:37 AM<br/>\nThe list is pretty complete although some things can changed depending on what is available to you.<br/>\n<br/>\n1. GSOT for 2h agro - droppable yes, no drop gear tons better<br/>\n2. TOD - the win everytime!<br/>\n3. Mosquito leg earring - Iron Scream earring, Bloodmetal earring of Engagement and Tear of the Rainmaker all much better.<br/>\n4. Thurg BP - any Velious BP or Shroud of Vigor from VT for the heal<br/>\n5. COF - solid haste for tradable gear<br/>\n6. Blood runed or Thurg Gaunts - disagree on this to begin with but if we are talking Velious gear then yes SS gaunts are the best choice.<br/>\n7. Incarnadine BP - replace with Cobalt Legs or Cloudy Steel Mask from VT (Both targetable invis so not only you but that cleric/pally in group is safe now to)<br/>\n8. Racial legs - Agree untill Farwater armor becomes more available then I would say those if we talkin droppable gear.<br/>\n9. Shouldars anything with 50+ hp is a good goal, the Dragonwing mantles arent bad<br/>\n10. Yaks - would definately replace that with BoC/any weapon<br/>\nEstebar<br/>\n05-23-2003, 12:10 PM<br/>\nIf you have the money, I\'d get a cowl of mortality+cloak of pernicity after the staff.

I thought about using Cobalt Leggings until I checked the price. <br/>\n<br/>\nI landed a GREAT deal on a Rubi BP (the new one) so I will hold out until I can get SS for the clicky. I need to work on faction, anyway - Sol B and the Planes have been my home until now, and I\'m waiting until 55 to get in a friend\'s guild that goes to Velious often (since no regular groups go into Kael anymore on my server). <br/>\n<br/>\nCloak of Flames and Mosquito Leg Earring (another great deal here ... couldn\'t afford engagement or scream) are also now mine. I have just enough PP left to pick up Greatstaff, Truncheon, and Incaradine. I\'m going to wait a few levels on SS for the gauntlets also. 90 HP is a big plus! <br/>\n<br/>\nAs for the dragonwing mantles - the best I found were 14 AC +55 HP. Does a gain of 25 HP justify a loss of 6 AC (which translates to 10+ as far as the actual statistic goes)? Forged Shoulderpads are 40k, way out of my range for justification. <br/>\n<br/>\nI\'m also thinking about buying some resist gear, which I know nothing about. I\'ll probably start a new thread asking for assistance on this.<br/>\nwandor<br/>\n05-23-2003, 05:39 PM<br/>\nBefore you spend a fortune on an invis BP, consider getting a gnomish vanishing device and a colapsable toolbox.

Red epic, GBoS and CHSD. The diff of agro from the CHSD and GBoS is nominal esp. in shorter fights it is usually a game of \"I hope this procs quick\" and they both have the potential to do that. All that being said, I prefer the GBoS because of the DPS. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as an offhand weapon, you can\'t go wrong with either the RE or the CHSD. I have not parsed out the diff. in DPS by using one or the other but the CHSD seems to proc more often.<br/>\n<br/>\nLourdin<br/>\nAzurik<br/>\n07-21-2003, 12:14 PM<br/>\nI find myself in a somewhat similar position and wanted some advice. I\'ve been using a BoC mainhand with a SoD offhand for quite awhile now. I recently picked up an Ancient Prismatic Mace. I decided to bag the SoD in a recent BoT exp group and used by BoC primary and prismatic in the secondary. I didn\'t notice any change in aggro.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, my question is what combo would you guys use given those 3 weapons?

I usually use 2x SoD and with those mobs stick to me like glue. If I swap my offhand SoD out for the stormrider carapace agro is terrible. The furious bash hate from the shield just can\'t make up for the loss of DPS from having no offhand weapon.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh and the GBoS is a lot easier to get than the CHSD IMO. 18 people can kill the water boss in BoT pretty easily and it takes far less time than killing xanamech.<br/>\ngelding<br/>\n07-21-2003, 07:28 PM<br/>\ni use gbos main + boc offhand for dps in exp groups,<br/>\n<br/>\nboc main + gbos offhand for aggro on raids or in exp grps where monks and wizards go crazy o.O<br/>\nSikkorak<br/>\n07-22-2003, 12:46 PM<br/>\nHave GBoS , red blade and CHSD.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust bagged the red blade when i got the GBoS.

If the mob is not cornerable however, the best way to deal with the mob moving is to put push on both sides the mob, with the dps behind it and the knights infront and to the sides to counter any push.

My sta is capped now with buffs anyway (no planar power yet) and I\'ve noticed that after 255 you get very little hp per sta anymore, some system of diminishing returns.

SS bp is really an exceptional cleric bp, if you have access to vindicator, i wouldnt give it a second thought. should ultimately cost fewer raid points if you do him regularily, and you should! <br/>\n<br/>\nthere isnt a better risk v reward mob in the game and good bps arent easy to come by unless you have access to tactics. the troll mini drops the ornate bp good bit, but its still not as common as the vindi bp even. the boots are excellent too, considering the mob, only bad drop is that stupid earring lol. you will probably even get a few ST keys out of the deal.<br/>\n1ludor<br/>\n07-08-2003, 02:22 AM<br/>\neradication bp is better than vindi imo. HPs are the same, but u get 10 more raw ac out eradication, most ppl killing vindicator havent maxed sta either. i cant remeber the last time resists mattered and 10attack is nothing. ac actually matters now, but its not easy to farm statue for bps unless you are the only guild killing him and i really doubt thats the case. id take the first one that came up, which would probably be the vindi bp. of course you should kill statue every chance ya get though.<br/>\nKiya<br/>\n07-08-2003, 03:56 AM<br/>\nIt depends how often you kill Vindi and farm Halls of Testing. If you do HoT more, grab that bp as soon as it drops. (Hell, do plate breastplates even drop in HoT?!

These are 2 different jobs. There has to be a person to assist in case something other than what the MT is tanking needs to be killed. This is also the person that picks the targets nad calls switching targets in cases when there are multiple mobs to kill and some are mezzable and some are not.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe MTs job is to tank the big dog. He has to focus on keeping agro and can\'t be off switching targets. This is the guy the cheal rotation is healing.<br/>\n<br/>\nOften the MT and MA will be on the same target, but some times they are not, which is why there are 2 jobs.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are also SA and ST, which would be secondary assist and secondary tank. The SA is the guy you assist when the MA dies, the ST is the guy who takes over boss tanking when the MT dies.<br/>\nTugurok<br/>\n08-08-2003, 02:41 AM<br/>\nI personally think the best MA is a smart wizard, who can keep an eye on the mobs and make decisions. MTs are usually MAs, but that\'s not always the best thing.<br/>\nVaraho<br/>\n08-08-2003, 05:33 AM<br/>\nThey are separate jobs, but that doesn’t mean some people cannot do both at the same time.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome people are just, well... simple, and get confused into calling them the same thing.<br/>\nDaramin<br/>\n08-08-2003, 05:36 AM<br/>\nPretty much any class could play the role of MA, the main thing is the person behind the keyboard. The MA has to be intelligent and hyper-knowledgeable about the game -- including the zone you\'re in, the design of the encounter, etc. They also have to be extremely reactive without losing track of the big picture.<br/>\n<br/>\nPersonally I find it extremely challenging to do both the MT and MA roles, but of course that\'s part of the fun of the game for me. There are plenty of situations where as MT I can\'t MA at all, more as time goes on (once you get any distance into PoP you\'re going to be splitting those roles up simply because the encounter requires it. I\'ve also heard Vex Thal requires this, although I haven\'t been there.)<br/>\nSmakz<br/>\n08-08-2003, 06:05 AM<br/>\nDaramin, VT doesnt need the split role, its mostly monotonous clearings of mobs with too many HP. and CH rotations arnt needed on anything but the named, and even thats debatable for some of them.<br/>\nWolveren<br/>\n08-08-2003, 06:25 AM<br/>\nAgnarr fight is a good example where MTank and Massist are not the same person. MT stays on Agnarr while MA calls out the adds.<br/>\nMaybe even more so in the 2 arenas before Agnarr where MT is on the named and everyone else is on the adds till they die.<br/>\nKoGuiN<br/>\n08-08-2003, 08:36 AM<br/>\nMy guild usues a *gasp* pally as MA most of the time, their gay stun get em high aggro in 1 cast. But no other than that (being MA) pally DO suck and so DO sk\'s. They only \"tank\" trash adds like the ones you get on your way to Agnarr, they never ever tank named tho, no way.<br/>\nBrudal the Fat<br/>\n08-08-2003, 09:29 AM<br/>\nMA is there to focus the dps of your raid imo. The MT is usually seperate or should be. If you are MT (the one with agro) it is hard to fast target for a raid. A person who can peel off at low life and have next target called for the MT to assist speeds things up tons. Especially in large crowds of people who are not shrank (don\'t get me started on that) and lots of mobs.<br/>\nSolinar<br/>\n08-08-2003, 11:38 AM<br/>\nWe have used wizzies as assist since we first entered Vex Thal (about 16 months ago? hard to remember back that far heh).<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat happens when your Main tank gets smoked. Who do you assist? A raid can go on without a MT, zerging mobs down and assist healing. A raid is much less likely cannot go on without an assist, as mezzed mobs get woken up, damage gets spread, and generally people act like tards.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso a wizzie can stand in front of the next target he/she plans to assist and as soon as the last one dies, target the next mob, so 0 time is lost finding next assist mob. Also a wizzie can take the time that the last mob is dieing to make the best decision for what to attack next, and doesnt have to worry about holding aggro or tanking like a warrior would.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor a raid, MA != MT works best for a multitude of reasons.<br/>\nAeryl<br/>\n08-08-2003, 02:13 PM<br/>\nMy guild usues a *gasp* pally as MA most of the time, their gay stun get em high aggro in 1 cast. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis is the kind of thinking that makes people believe they are the same thing. Technically, the MA does not need to get aggro or tank anything.<br/>\nRevlinXevlin<br/>\n08-08-2003, 02:42 PM<br/>\nThat was basically my point. In every guild I\'ve been in since I was able to raid fairly important stuff there has been no line between who and what class is the MA and who is the MT. Personally in a raid situation I want someone MA who can stop, drop, and roll if need be. But whatever gets the kill I guess works. I just like things to be clear.<br/>\nDrunken Mick<br/>\n08-08-2003, 03:15 PM<br/>\nDun forget teh RT!!<br/>\n<br/>\nRampage Tank<br/>\nRevlinXevlin<br/>\n08-08-2003, 05:21 PM<br/>\nI have never heard of a Rampage tank hehe<br/>\nWolveren<br/>\n08-08-2003, 08:03 PM<br/>\nRampage tanks are for mobs that do a lot of damage with their rampage (rampage is melee damage that goes to a person other then the player the mob is hitting). Some mobs can kill clerics and other casters with their rampage in one or two rounds, if it\'s not set properly to go to a rampage tank with dedicated healers it\'s going to eat up your raidforce one by one at a sometimes amazing rate.<br/>\nFiguring out how to deal with boss mobs that rampage is an important step in a guild\'s progression.<br/>\nWychway<br/>\n08-08-2003, 08:47 PM<br/>\nI often MA and MT trash.

It\'s statistical variation. Your mainhand procs more than your offhand, it\'s how it works. You\'ll also notice that mainhand, the BoC did proc more than the SoD did mainhand for Brutul.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey\'re the same (allowing for margin of error from RNG randomness in a short period of time), just like we\'ve been saying all along.<br/>\nMearis<br/>\n10-08-2003, 06:36 AM<br/>\n...<br/>\n<br/>\nLike people have been saying all along? Half the threads on this board insist that BoC is \'utter shit\' because it has an incredibly crappy proc ratio - now someone actually parsed the numbers and show that within the same statistical error the BoC and SoD both proc the exact same amount of time<br/>\n<br/>\nBrutul\'s point is that they do proc the exact same amount, and that nobody in their right mind would argue that Anarchy is more aggro than Enraging Blow, and DPS with BoC main handed is superior to SoD (though I could imagine on incredibly high AC mobs SoD would outdps it)<br/>\nGerald<br/>\n10-08-2003, 06:58 AM<br/>\nI just did a 45 minute parse myself on the banker and these are my results. I had 170 DEX, 36 percent haste, and 0 offensive AAs (except punishing blade :p):<br/>\n<br/>\nBlasephemous Blade of the Exiled - 109 procs = 2.42 procs per minute<br/>\nBlade of Carnage - 22 procs = 0.49 procs per minute<br/>\nCall of Fire (from Gloves of the Crimson Sigil) - 46 = 1.02 procs per minute<br/>\nIcicle Strike (on Blasphemous Blade) - 74 = 1.64 procs per minute<br/>\nHeated Blade (on Blade of Carnage) - 31 = 0.69 procs per minute<br/>\n<br/>\nConclusion - Blade of Carnage should proc a lot more than once every 2 minutes in the offhand <E>:(</E>. I don\'t have EQ Companion installed yet since I reformatted my hard drive, and as a result I don\'t have a DPS figure at this time. However, procs from my mainhand weapon accounted for 5 DPS or so (including the Icicle Strike aug :p).<br/>\n<br/>\nGoing to do a parse with my primal warsword in my offhand to see how much it affects my proc rate of my mainhand weapon having 90 extra dex up (I lose 10 dex when I swap my BoC for my Primal Warsword).<br/>\nHaass<br/>\n10-08-2003, 07:14 AM<br/>\nBrutul\'s point is that they do proc the exact same amount, and that nobody in their right mind would argue that Anarchy is more aggro than Enraging Blow, and DPS with BoC main handed is superior to SoD (though I could imagine on incredibly high AC mobs SoD would outdps it) <br/>\n<br/>\nI think you went a step overboard here. They do proc the same, but that\'s not really why everyone says the proc rate sucks. People who say the BoC proc rate sucks are using a bloodfrenzy, which has been proven to proc more, which is why they say it sucks.<br/>\n<br/>\nSecond, there are plenty of people who argued that Anarchy was superior to EB, and they have been doing so since Velious. Fact of the matter is that until we know exactly how much hate is generated by a stun component spell, we\'ll never know the exact answer. I can say with certainty that it\'s not a huge difference. 1 EB proc will lock that mob on me thru a slow, but so will an Anarchy and so will a Force Shock. I would hardly call the argument that EB is superior conclusive. (for the record, i\'m not saying that EB isn\'t superior, i\'m saying that stun hate value is an unknown variable, and until we know that, no one can say one way or the other) I can say that Anarchy is more than sufficient for 90% of EQ players however. If EB is superior, it\'s already more aggro than you need.<br/>\n<br/>\nThird, I don\'t know if EQCompanion includes procs in their DPS figures, to be quite honest, I don\'t know if I trust them, but with Ingenuity 3, I throw out some fuckin nice DPS with SoD mainhand getting 576 blasts every other fight or so. BoC is only weapon DPS. On anything other than total MR mobs, the SoD has to outdamage the BoC. I just can\'t believe it doesn\'t. 2 procs per minute with an SoD is an extra 576 damage, which equates to almost 10dps. BoC ratio doesn\'t beat SoD by 10dps, no way, no how.<br/>\n<br/>\nIs the BoC \"Utter shit?\" I don\'t know. I can definitely tell you that it\'s not worth the price tag it carries to me tho, and I\'ve used one, so I know what i\'m talking about.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe thing that really shocks me in Brutul\'s, Gerald\'s and my parsings is that putting a weapon in your offhand essentially fuckin kills it\'s proc rate. Do we really only dual wield 50% of the time, even with Ambidex (me only)? That seems really low.<br/>\nMearis<br/>\n10-08-2003, 07:45 AM<br/>\nI think BoC vs SoD dps can be plotted as two curves and as a function of (ATK / mob AC) on the x-axis and DPS on y-axis.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn mobs like Creator, I am positive an SoD will destroy a BoC due to Creator\'s insane AC plus his AC debuff, however in a place like a LDoN group with a moderately buffed ATK (avatar &amp; grim aura + a few random pieces of ATK from gear) a BoC will handily outparse it.<br/>\n<br/>\nA bigger portion of SoD\'s DPS comes from its proc damage which doesn\'t scale with improved attack and lower mob AC.<br/>\n<br/>\nAbout the aggro from the two procs, every warrior in my guild except our main tank uses BoC + GBoS and has a GSo4W for DPS. While doing a LDoN hard adventure, the aggro difference was very noticable between the one warrior who used GBoS/BoC vs the warrior using BoC/GBoS (although admittedly that is a HUGE simplification).<br/>\n<br/>\nAs a nuker class with no means to reduce my aggro, I am of the firm beliefe that a enraging blow proc allows me to nuke harder, although I cannot exactly quantify how much harder.<br/>\nGerald<br/>\n10-08-2003, 08:23 AM<br/>\nRemoved information pending a much longer parse<br/>\nSplaktar<br/>\n10-08-2003, 10:54 AM<br/>\nIf you are going to do parses for Procs Per Minute they need to be well over 45 minutes. Try 5-8 hours...<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyone parse a HG? I\'m quite sure it procs more than BoC.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn reply to the quote about Anarchy vs EB... I would argue that Anarchy is better aggro than EB <E>:P</E><br/>\nBrutul<br/>\n10-08-2003, 12:07 PM<br/>\nIf we want to know exactly what the proc rate is then yea a longer log would be better. But I think these are long enough to show that\'s there\'s not much difference between the two, and the BoC doesn\'t \"suck\".<br/>\n<br/>\nI could run a longer log, but I have no idea how to parse it. I\'m pretty sure EQcompanion can\'t handle a 50,000 hit fight, and I couldn\'t see any way to get it to count procs so I had to do that manually using the \'find\' utility in notepad. No way I can do that on an 8 hour log.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am an eqcompanion rookie mostly, but I think procs are included in it\'s dps parse. Mearis has a good point though, that a weapon that does proc DPS would shine on a fight with higher level, higher AC mobs while tanking. This parse was done on a green con attacking from the back, so that may skew the numbers somewhat toward the better ratio weapon. Of course your procs could get resisted more often as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nEdit: If anyone that is a better parser wants to check my logs out, PM me with your email address.<br/>\nSplaktar<br/>\n10-08-2003, 12:42 PM<br/>\nEQ Companion can parse some pretty big log files if you set it up correctly. And it depends on how much RAM you have.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso EQ Companion lists DD procs, but doesn\'t count EB. MS Word works for counting procs. Just do a \'Find\' and have it find all. Then it\'ll give you the # of matches found. I used this for the riposte parses.<br/>\nNaralli_VoLS<br/>\n10-08-2003, 02:57 PM<br/>\nIs there any evidence that the mobs you are fighting affect proc rates?<br/>\nI would be interested in reviewing parses taken from actual combat scenarios of mobs a 65 warrior would regularily fight rather than some non combatant green con.<br/>\nI *KNOW* i have gone for well over an hour or more and not seen my Blade of Carnage proc.

The Safehouse melee tests were done for 8 hours if I recall (god I wish those were still available to read now), and they found that the offhand procs about a quarter as often as the mainhand. It was pretty clear from those results that the offhand has a built-in penalty to its proc rate.

If you don\'t like the taste of pie, then don\'t eat it. But what you\'re telling me is that it\'s not pie, even though I can look at it and tell that it is. If you want to sell your BoC then by all means do it, but you came here with no data, posted something that was quickly disproven by people *with* data, and here you are still talking.<br/>\n<br/>\nEither post the data or quit talking about it. We don\'t want people posting misinformation on a board that many people come to for information and advice.

I\'ll let you know the results when I install EQ companion (doing that now).<br/>\nBrutul<br/>\n10-08-2003, 08:26 PM<br/>\nWe are definitely gonna get the katta bankers nerfed hehe.<br/>\nUukla<br/>\n10-08-2003, 08:36 PM<br/>\nNaralll, I think part of the problem is that you are saying your BoC is somehow different than thiers in proc rate. (re, your apple pie comment)<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the real world, my mother in law bakes a kick ass apple pie, that totally smokes my moms pies. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut this is a digital game. The same code that is on your BoC is the code on every other BoC in the game, period. It theoretically cannot be broke.<br/>\n<br/>\nNo matter the results of your parse, you percieve agro issues with your BoC, so I dont think a parse is going to change that. My suggestion would be to sell it no matter what, and find something you feel comfortable with, because a parse telling you it proced 1 per minute isnt going to change your situation.<br/>\ndethvegi1<br/>\n10-08-2003, 08:47 PM<br/>\nOriginally posted by Brutul <br/>\nWe are definitely gonna get the katta bankers nerfed hehe. <br/>\n<br/>\nI hope not <E>:(</E> . Any way to stop her damn spamming just out of curiousity ?<br/>\nGerald<br/>\n10-09-2003, 06:42 AM<br/>\nOK!<br/>\n<br/>\nI did a 386 minute (about 6 and a half hours) parse with EQ Companion and these are my results. There is an increase in proc rate compared to my previous parse of 45 minutes. This is with 36 percent haste, 197 Dex, Blasphemous Blade mainhand, Blade of Carnage offhand:<br/>\n<br/>\nBlasphemous Blade of the Exiled - 1047 procs = 2.71 procs per minute<br/>\nBlade of Carnage - 323 procs = 0.84 procs per minute<br/>\nIcicle Strike (aug on mainhand) - 626 procs = 1.62 procs per minute<br/>\nHeated Blade (aug on offhand) - 310 procs = 0.80 procs per minute<br/>\n<br/>\nDPS including DD procs was 78.30. DD procs accounted for 6.82 DPS.<br/>\nKilaara<br/>\n10-09-2003, 07:04 AM<br/>\nGerald the BBotE is - like the BF - one of the rare ones who do proc more than normal. So your result = 2,71 = around 40 % better procrate = the same the BF has in some tests in the past.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor Offhandprocs there were rumors that they are fixed on the base of 80 dex so its irrelevant which dex you have they will always proc as if you have 80 dex.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe someone with 80 dex should make a mainhandtest and look if he will also have then 1 Proc / Minute with a normal proccing weapon.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I looked at your other parses I noticed that the augment on the BBotE has only a normal proc rate. Did this happen also in your last long parse ? That would documentate that the proc rate of augments is not a question of the weapon in which they would be done.<br/>\nGerald<br/>\n10-09-2003, 10:12 AM<br/>\nI edited my previous post to show the information you requested.<br/>\nBrutul<br/>\n10-09-2003, 12:34 PM<br/>\nRan a 10 hour log on the banker last night.

Here is a summary of main hand proc rates of several weapons from different people:<br/>\n<br/>\nBoC - 1.57 proc/min (Wandor, 14 hr parse)<br/>\nSoDx2 - 1.45 proc/min (Gigantuous, 40 min parse)**<br/>\nBBoE - 2.71 proc/min (Gerald, 6.5 hr parse)<br/>\nBoC - 1.39 proc/min (Brutul, 10 hr parse)<br/>\nBoC - 1.71 proc/min (Brutul, 45 min parse)<br/>\nSoD - 1.48 proc/min (Brutul, 46 min parse)<br/>\nBBoE - 2.42 proc/min (Gerald, 45 min parse)<br/>\n<br/>\n** This parse would probably have to be thrown out, that proc rate does not seem to match what one would expect for dual weilding SoDs. With the length of the parse, the margin of error would be pretty large, but that parse is a good illustration of the streaky nature of the RNG. I would imagine if that parse would have continued another 3-4 hours, the combined proc rate of 2x SoD would probably be closer to 2.25-2.5 proc/min (1.5 mainhand + .75 offhand).<br/>\nUukla<br/>\n10-21-2003, 07:10 AM<br/>\nproblem with sod proc parsing is you have to look for full resists too.<br/>\nSam DeathWalker<br/>\n10-21-2003, 09:36 AM<br/>\nLet me ask sum noob questions to see if I can get some rough rule of thumb here.<br/>\n<br/>\nPPM=Procs Per Minute<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTwo Hander = 2ppm<br/>\n<br/>\nSingle Hand Weapons<br/>\n<br/>\nOne Hander alone or as part of duel wield set up = 1.5ppm<br/>\nOff Hander in duel wield set up = .75ppm<br/>\nTotal 2.25ppm<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nDPS:<br/>\n<br/>\n2Hander<br/>\n((damage X 2) plus bonus)) / delay = modal hit<br/>\n<br/>\n1Hander in main hand only no offhand<br/>\n((damage X 2) plus bonus)) / delay = modal hit<br/>\n<br/>\n1Hander in main hand and one in off hand<br/>\nMainHand DPS: (((damage X 2) plus bonus)) / delay) X 2/3 <br/>\nOffhand DPS: ((damage X 2) / delay) X 1/3<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nObviously the above, as to DPS, is incorrect as the duel wield does less DPS then just using a 1Hander weapon with no offhand weapon.

I believe it is thought to be 1:1, at least in terms of comparing it with other, more known hate methods. In addition, I believe some nukes, spells, and/or AA\'s have a hate reduction modifier, which would reduce the hate from a DD spell to less than 1:1. <br/>\n<br/>\nFor melee DPS, I remember reading that it is not only the damage dealt, but also the potential damage from that weapon. That\'s how a big 2H weapon can be helpful in holding agro, even if you\'re in front of a mob.<br/>\n<br/>\nStun is thought to be approx 400-500 points in hate, whether landed, resisted, or immune.

You also get a knockback which reduces agro due to the extra distance, but that\'s easily compensated for.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat said, I don\'t understand why people drool over Anger ll rather than Ykesha for the same points.<br/>\nsowy<br/>\n02-18-2004, 07:42 PM<br/>\nWell at least I don\'t feel so bad for not knowing.<br/>\nMokor Leadheaad<br/>\n02-18-2004, 08:50 PM<br/>\nthe easy answer to yk vs. anger is when the chips are down you grab the proc that adds pure agro, and put the toys away.<br/>\nVladymir<br/>\n02-19-2004, 05:26 AM<br/>\nI don\'t think we exactly know what a DD equals in terms of hate. I believe it is thought to be 1:1 If it were, then my delightfull orb would (325 base proc) would clearly beat my Hooked Soshar (250 hate add), but the consensus is no...<br/>\n<br/>\nBut when you take into effect a stunning weapon like the copper hammer, or any stun proc, or augs like the ones from guk, who knows?<br/>\n<br/>\nYour closest competiton for hate other than \'anger\' type augs or effects will be stun... so I would *think* the copper hammer\'s innate effect would be more anger than the delightful orb\'s even though its only about half the damage in DD terms.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen of course, plain old fashioned speed matters; most agree that being hit 5 times for 100 damage is superior aggro to getting hit 2 times for 250 damage each time.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the old days, before bows were da bomb for Rangers, they used to carry 2 handers to keep down their aggro, even if the damage was about the same, or more than their 2 1 handers.<br/>\nsowy<br/>\n02-19-2004, 08:07 AM<br/>\nHow much aggro would a 750dd be then? (ala Infamous ED from time)<br/>\nNeksnappa<br/>\n02-19-2004, 08:09 AM<br/>\nQest, I\'m almost positive that slow is more than 300 aggro. When I duo with my shammy, and slow a mob at the beginning of each fight, I would be able to get aggro back onto my warrior with just incite, since it is 400 aggro. This doesn\'t happen though. Incite plus maybe 5 seconds of melee, or a weapon proc, is enough to get the mob off the shammy, so I\'m thinking slow is 425-450 aggro.<br/>\nQest<br/>\n02-19-2004, 08:36 AM<br/>\nI\'m still experimenting so no definitive answers yet, but here\'s what I have so far:<br/>\n<br/>\nIn a normal LDoN a while back, I hit auto-attack but was slightly out of range so I just got the message \"you\'re out of range\" a bunch of times. The mob got slowed and immediately afterwards, I procced a stun without ever actually making a valid swing at the target (including misses), yet the mob turned on me.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat\'s my only evidence for Stun &gt; Slow.<br/>\n<br/>\nI\'m testing, and I don\'t have enough data yet, but it\'s my impression that Incite gets a negative modifier if you haven\'t damaged the mob yet. It\'s still some agro, you can pull with it, but it seems to me to work better if I do some damage via an arrow before hitting Incite.<br/>\nHaass<br/>\n02-19-2004, 08:48 AM<br/>\nthe easy answer to yk vs. anger is when the chips are down you grab the proc that adds pure agro, and put the toys away. <br/>\n<br/>\nI\'m not sure the answer is that easy. I played with a BoC for a couple of months and ended up dumping it because SoD/Copper Hammer just fucking destroyed BoC/SoD for DPS, and I wasn\'t experiencing an aggro deficiency in either setup. Why gimp your DPS on pure hate procs when stun procs clearly seem to be of a similar quality?<br/>\n<br/>\nI\'m also not sure exactly how to test slow vs stun. I\'ve had stuns lock aggro on me over a slow, and I also remember one occurance where a planar strike proc off a bloodsworn DIDN\'T hold aggro thru a slow. This doesn\'t happen often tho, so I\'m not sure what caused it, but we definitely can\'t rule out other factors in the aggro consideration. I\'m also hesistant to put a number as low as 300 on stun aggro because in my opinion, a proc works much better than incite does.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow much aggro would a 750 dd be? Probably miniscule.<br/>\nBalfamor<br/>\n02-19-2004, 09:13 AM<br/>\nIMO, the hate generated off of pure hate and stun procs seem to be close enough to make going with stuns a better option for the added benefit of interrupts and such from the stun. I will probably save up and put stun augs in weapons that already have pure agro procs (or visa-versa), and have some of both.<br/>\nQest<br/>\n02-19-2004, 09:26 AM<br/>\nAgro is obviously modified by the target. Look at AoW for example, he\'s got so very many hitpoints, that most anything you do is not going to establish agro lock.<br/>\n<br/>\nI play an enchanter and I\'ve learned that generally, Tash agro is in relation to the target\'s hitpoints, so Tashing AoW will probably be an instant death while tashing a Normal LDoN mob is a lot less agro. If slow is the same way, and I\'d be surprised if it wasn\'t, that would explain the varying results.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen there\'s always distance...<br/>\nBigchest<br/>\n02-19-2004, 10:36 AM<br/>\nback when i had CHSD in mainhand which was 450 hate proc i was in ldon which the shaman pulled with a slow, i crushed once then proc\'d and mob turned on me, so im guessing slow is around 400 hate<br/>\nsowy<br/>\n02-21-2004, 01:42 AM<br/>\nI wonder if damage based aggro is determined by the HP of the mob aswell. It would make sense.<br/>\n<br/>\nWould be easy to test on green mobs. Have someone else do a 1k nuke on a mob with 1.5k hp then a warrior try to incite it. Or something. Then repeat on a higher hp mob.<br/>\n<br/>\nThough I have a feeling all the answers I need are hidden on an old thread (though I was unable to find it with search feature--and I did try)<br/>\nvBulletin v3.0.3, Copyright ©2000-2005, Jelsoft Enterprises Ltd.</t>','98215c8e5031b6063db1ebcdc85dd2b7',0,'','4dy9hjwh',1,0,'',0,0,0,1,0,'',0),(62,62,36,2,0,'50.25.122.79',1506264202,0,1,1,1,1,'','DPS formula?

I had thought that once I put the anger3 aug on the staff, I would have aggro locked down like the 1hander combo, but it doesn\'t seem to work that well. Granted I haven\'t parsed things for dps, and I only have a subjective observation from 2 LDONs, but I would have hoped that the staff + anger 3 would be better then my two un-auged weapons with no ambidex AA.<br/>\n<br/>\nComments?<br/>\nJakle Attakle<br/>\n02-23-2004, 10:59 AM<br/>\nI was truly hoping this as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nSigh, any anecdotes on the GS04W aug\'d with Anger III.<br/>\n<br/>\nOr just more info from you Zeek?

With the numbers so close, I guess I will parse them myself and report back in a couple of days.<br/>\n<br/>\n/pure observations without parsing next<br/>\nThe subjective comparisons I\'ve done have been against normal LDONs mostly and some against HoH guards and suits. In hard LDONs I go with 2hander, as I take more damage with the 1handers. In those normal LDONs, the mobs *seem* to go down faster with my 2 1handers. <br/>\nAs for aggro, the 2 1handers held aggro better then the un-auged GSot4W, but that I will try it both ways again this week. I don\'t have ambi/PB, and don\'t plan on getting either of those in the next 10 days or so as I\'m working on the advanced defensives currently. My 4 melee stats are always maxed at 290 right now.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy standard approach for comparison only is as follow:<br/>\nnormal LDON: I\'m usually the puller and I pull with an Incite, run to group(short run at most), start attacking mob and taunt immediately. With 1 handers this is usually sufficient now to lock aggro for the rest of the fight with regular taunts as I usually proc pretty quickly. With un-auged 2 hander, unless I managed to taunt successfully twice after the incite, I would lose the mob to anyone\'s slow.<br/>\nhard LDON: I\'m usually not the puller. <E>;)</E> Bard comes in with a mob, and I assist/incite just before mob is on the group. The bard runs past me and the mob stops on me. I then proceed to attack with 2 hander and taunt. 4 out of 5 mobs, I lose aggro to the slower. When I tried this with the 1 handers I would get just a *little* bit better control of the mob, maybe 3 out of 5 I would lose, but it wasn\'t worth the riposte. I attribute this to the higher AC/abilities of the hard mobs to completely avoiding my swings and thus less procs on them. It seems a little better with the aug on the 2 hander, but we\'ll see.<br/>\n<br/>\nDid that make sense? Consistent with what others are seeing?<br/>\nJakle Attakle<br/>\n02-23-2004, 02:33 PM<br/>\nYou said up top that GSo4W was aug\'d. Then it says unaug\'d in this post.<br/>\n<br/>\nDo you have Anger III on the GSo4W now?<br/>\n<br/>\nEverything else makes sense. Very interested in what you find. We are even at the same level of PP atm, and GSo4W is my next upgrade weap.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks Zeek.<br/>\n<br/>\nJakle<br/>\nYgnir<br/>\n02-23-2004, 04:28 PM<br/>\nMight want to try Incite on inc, then wait till the slow has landed (resist or not) and then taunt if mob turns from you... If you have an Anger3 proc on the staff, an early anger proc basicly means you won\'t need to taunt at all, mob won\'t even look at shammy.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen you\'re comfy with the way mobs are pulled on to you and the position of your shammy, you can also forgo the incite, engage and wait for slow to land, then taunt, then incite, based on the idea that the taunt jumps you to top hate and the incite will build up a nice aggro buffer, or hope (if the taunt fails) that the incite + DPS will pull aggro off shammy.... an anger proc at any time will just lock it for you. And GSo4W + Anger3 procs a lot )<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the other hand, if your shammy debuffs before slow, an early Incite means the aggro-dot will run longer, building up more hate, making a slow less noticable aggro wise..<br/>\nzeeko<br/>\n02-26-2004, 02:03 PM<br/>\nJakle: I wrote the original after getting the anger3 aug and only doing 1 hard ldon with it. That\'s why I was still comparing 2 one-handers, augged 2 hander, and un-augged 2 hander.<br/>\n<br/>\nYgnir: Thanks for the suggestion. I\'ve tried that many times, but it really seems to depend on the slower. If it\'s a pickup chanter that\'s doing tash/slow right away and standing away from the mob, I tend to lose it if I don\'t incite/taunt up front. If it\'s someone who has a clue about their class and has worked non-knight tanks, then they usually throw the slow from near melee range and we\'re good either way.<br/>\n<br/>\nBack to the original question of the 2h vs. 2 1h:<br/>\nI\'ve had some more time and situations to play with the anger3 augged gsot4w, and I like it. It *holds* aggro just as well it seems as the one-hander combo, but it does have 2 minor deficiencies. The first is that it looks like a crappy cattle prod. The second is that doesn\'t have as much pure snap aggro as augged one-handers. I do have WA1 from GoD AA and getting that to WA3 or even WA5 should fix the snap aggro a bit.<br/>\nI don\'t think there\'s anything to do for the look. <E>;)</E><br/>\nvBulletin® v3.8.4, Copyright ©2000-2011, Jelsoft Enterprises Ltd.</r>','944bfb13ca5fc43c6de87e347dcb2f5e',0,'','1ikh0n5p',1,0,'',0,0,0,1,0,'',0),(63,63,36,2,0,'50.25.122.79',1506264425,0,1,1,1,1,'','Haste Stacking with clicky items','<r>eurazmus<br/>\n03-28-2004, 06:40 PM<br/>\nI have read a few guides on haste stacking but they seem to be a bit vague.<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes the clicky haste on Kizrak\'s Gauntlets of Battle (<URL url=\"http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=18000\">http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=18000</URL>) stack with the worn haste of Cloak of Flames (<URL url=\"http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=2190\">http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=2190</URL>) or do you only get the haste from the higher of the two?<br/>\n<br/>\nI am getting conflicting information and wondered if anyone has some definitive info b4 i blow 35k.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers all<br/>\nGront<br/>\n03-28-2004, 06:44 PM<br/>\nOne is spell haste, one item haste.

Maybe I can get lucky there sometime <E>:)</E>.<br/>\ngulug<br/>\n07-08-2004, 01:56 AM<br/>\nif your main group is ep enabled, provided your tank is ok no reason u cant take a shot at getting the Greatblade of storms from BoT tower. that will be a nice upgrade to CHoS. if you can get a ench to charm makes it all the faster. To make it easier if you can get abou 8-9 including 2 clerics should be no problem at all.<br/>\nFrostpaw<br/>\n07-08-2004, 06:12 AM<br/>\nNot sure how few it would take to get the Obsidian Scimitar of War from VZ. I have only done him as a full blown raid, but it is very easy. I understand he is being done with a 1-2 groups now regularly. Maybe more experienced people here on the boards can confirm or deny this. In any case, I would put that on your list along with GBoS as potential upgrades.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, the droppable gaunts/wrist/boots from hard LDoN might be an option if your cleric could win them there. Better than ornate as far as AC/HP go in all three slots.<br/>\nKebast<br/>\n07-08-2004, 06:48 AM<br/>\nAlso, the droppable gaunts/wrist/boots from hard LDoN might be an option if your cleric could win them there. Better than ornate as far as AC/HP go in all three slots.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe problem is our group can\'t quite do hard LDoN\'s yet, at least for the success points. We haven\'t tried just name hunting. My normal group has a Pally tank that went for all Offensive AA first. He\'s working the Defense now. A few more nights grinding AA and we might be ready. Also, we usually do NBG loot with Mains getting loot over alts. The PoP hits might be the way to go. Still need a few levels/flags for that though. Good to know there are options. I got his Wind-worn BP in a pick up hit on BoT mini\'s. We did those with 8 people, so I know what you mean about some PoP boss\'s being easy hits.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks.<br/>\nEoden<br/>\n07-09-2004, 12:08 AM<br/>\nI have done Vallon with 2 groups, they were ele geared and had a high number of tanks and healers though. With a good pull team who know the event Im sure it could be done with 1 group, but for casual players who dont have gear from raiding it may be a bit of a stretch.<br/>\n<br/>\nXTC should also be doable with a couple of groups although hategiver is absurdly rare. Ofcourse the same applys, whats one groupable by time players isnt neccessarily going to be 1 groupable by players who would actually want the gear the mob drops.<br/>\nKebast<br/>\n07-09-2004, 12:24 PM<br/>\nOfcourse the same applys, whats one groupable by time players isnt neccessarily going to be 1 groupable by players who would actually want the gear the mob drops.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust to give you an Idea...The Vadyn in AR is doable by my normal group. Most of the Fabled gear my warrior has was also obtained 1 group style by the same group members. We just got access to PoFire a couple of weeks ago, so we\'re not EP geared...just EP able <E>:)</E>.

I have logging on by default, so I\'ll play around with it and the Fabled SSoY. I usually 3 box LDoN\'s with a cleric and rogue, so I use one weapon combination per run. That gives me a pretty good estimation. I parsed the Fabled executioner\'s axe last night. At my level with no AA\'s and level 1 tribute haste it gave me 27.3 average DPS. Which is ~1-2 % higher than my DW combo. The haste proc helps a lot. Not sure what the proc rate is suppose to be, but it seems to proc a lot. I was suprised...the 2hander seemed to hold agro better than the DW setup...guess I shouldn\'t be surprised, max hit was 215+ and I saw a crit for 410 <E>:)</E>.<br/>\nvBulletin v3.0.3, Copyright ©2000-2005, Jelsoft Enterprises Ltd.</r>','60b0786ac3e95861f3afcfd6c87c4753',0,'','2ys5960x',1,0,'',0,0,0,1,0,'',0),(65,65,35,2,0,'50.25.122.79',1506305332,0,1,1,1,1,'','Advice on Raiding Vindi','<r>Our guildis up and Coming adn ready to try Vindi. tell me if this tactic will work or is flawed?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<U><s>[u]</s>To pull<e>[/u]</e></U>,<br/>\nHall and Arena must be cleared, 20 min spawn cycle.<br/>\nRaid sets up outside Arena, rightside against wall.<br/>\nMonk1 tags guardian, 2 guardians follow, FD, Monk2 who is FDed waits till Gaurds start to walk then monk stands and tags, FDing at Ramp leading out of Arena.<br/>\nMT tags single Gaurd, kill, rinse repeat with 2nd Gaurd.<br/>\n<br/>\nVinidi is pulled by monk1, FDs at ramp.

At least, thats all I ever used mine for. <br/>\n<br/>\nSince the Incite line came out, I\'ve used my bow a grand total of 4 times. For pulling mobs that I couldn\'t get close to. The range on Incite is long enough that you can use it as a pulling tool, and you get more aggro from an Incite than you do from an arrow. (Warrior archery is the suck) One caveat: I was 65 when these came out, so I\'ve never actually used the lower level ones. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo, screw getting a good bow. Keep around some long range hunk of crap for the few times you do need a long range tag, and use a decent UI to allow easy swapping of it on the fly (Sars, for example). Then spend your time and effort getting a range slot item that has decent stats. *cough* Marsinger quests *cough*<br/>\n<br/>\nDDT</r>','ae4f25eb3447f7f8839b0b186561e011',0,'','3orhgxqd',1,0,'',0,0,0,1,0,'',0),(70,67,35,2,0,'50.25.122.79',1506305493,0,1,1,1,1,'','How to get to 50ish','<t>OK after ur done screwing around and get to lvl 9-10 get over to Crushbone till 15... then when you get to 15 high tail it to PC till 25. now go to HHK till 37.

The benefits of AA\'s are far greater imo. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe reason I say it depends on your guild, is from everything I hear (not in ele planes myself) ele planes are phenominal exp at 65. The sad fact is that at 65 in PoV/BoT/HoH/CoD my aa exp is cut roughly in half compared to what it was at 61.

Definitely pick up the Black Blade of Torment - the proc is a DD plus a DoT, so it picks up nice aggro. Couple it with a +dex weapon in the offhand. Or even put the Barnacle Covered Axe in your offhand -- proc and each and no one will taunt off of you. Don\'t go with the Glowing Black sword - that proc is self...not on the mob...<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, if you;re having probs while duel-boxing a druid, I am wondering what the druid is doing to get aggro?

Each mobs at pool gives 2 faction hits, there are 25 mobs to kill at pool is you keep it clear, you need 2301 faction hits to non kos, which means you ve to round the pool about 46 times to get enough faction to hand in the heads.

One is your \'default\' adjustment for that faction, or your \'starting faction\'. This includes your religion and race (perhaps class as well, I forget). The other are your \'actions\' represented by faction hits in game.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhatever you starting faction is you can go +/- 2k from it. For example if you are default scowls to a faction it means you base faction adjustment was about -800 or worse. So you can get all the way down to -2800 which is why scowls is so huge to get out of. On the positive side that base -800 means that at best you can get ~+1200 or so, which is why Ally in Velious is so easy to lose.</t>','de10bd805ddf8e4268ba9d627ef3512e',0,'','31nsyg2m',1,0,'',0,0,0,1,0,'',0),(178,92,35,2,0,'50.25.122.79',1506307806,0,1,1,1,1,'','Re: King Tormax Faction','<t>this info was perfect...thanks a lot....<br/>\n<br/>\none question though....<br/>\n<br/>\nHow big of a hit is Velks?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nRosh</t>','f50dff231c66c62d3320c00e0dbd3957',0,'','2zlvwm5c',1,0,'',0,0,0,1,0,'',0),(179,93,35,2,0,'50.25.122.79',1506307848,0,1,1,1,1,'','tentative spawn times','<t>I copied the table from the old spawn times thread to here.

What we saw was that the outer yellow cons, would respawn regardless of if stone fortifications were up, and as a result you could get multiple sets of fortifications.<br/>\n<br/>\nNone of that mattered since the event was moved to the next step not by clearing sides, but simply by clearing x number of fortifications. Atleast one other earth event was exactly the same (rock beasts), where it kept track of only how many things had died, and didn\'t care when or from where they died.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter the patch, it\'s been changed and it actually does reset.<br/>\n<br/>\nBecause of the pathing issues we used to have we did it in sequence and moved around the outside, doing the lower ones, then the upper yellow and then fortifications. It reset every time doing it that way.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe last time, sunday I think, we did it and we were halfway through the fourth side, when it reset. We had done it quickly we thought, but we could do it faster so we moved right in front, and we began to just destroy everything. I pulled the front 2, then their fortifications, then the right two, and fortifications, left 2, and fortifications, and it reset partway through then.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe did something else after that but today we tried it again. Straight up clearing same way as we used to, moving around the outside, it reset on the third side.<br/>\n<br/>\nSomeone suggested we spawn all fortifications first and since literally the event had reset on us like 5 times in a row trying it the sequenced way and we\'re pretty much experts on slaughtering it, I said whatever.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I pulled all 4 sets of top spawns and at that point, all fortifications were up. We pulled and cleared two sides and then had to pause. I literally watched the top 2 guards on the side we were at, spawn and despawn near instantly. The other place I have seen this is on rock beast platform when the yellows come around to spawn, you can see them appear for a split second.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs we were paused, the other two side sets of yellow guards, spawned, which caused their fortifications to despawn. The event did not reset because when it does, the entire platform spawns, so I pulled all of the guards on top (4 of them), which caused the two sets of fortifications to spawn.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe pulled both of those and killed them. We were expecting the next phase of the event, but nothing occured. None of the yellow guards respawned either while we were in the zone.<br/>\n<br/>\nI honestly don\'t know the specifics of the triggers involved but like I said, where the triumvirate is usually, had mobs spawn around the same time as we finished all of the platform fortification. <br/>\n<br/>\nParv are you saying that if you just restart from where it resets, it\'ll still go? Basically, from what I\'ve seen, doing it in sequence doesn\'t work, and it resets randomly when you do that. Doing it in stages is the only thing lately that atleast gave us feedback that we were doing it right, even if it ended up seeming to not work.</t>','cb48b46c70df61803e145ee21bcf57a5',0,'','17qyouio',1,0,'',0,0,0,1,0,'',0),(236,101,35,2,0,'50.25.122.79',1506309171,0,1,1,1,1,'','Emerald Warriors Faction','<t>I\'m looking for as much info as possible with Charm of the Emerald Warrior and the related faction.<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst, what\'s the best way to raise this faction (dubious atm), and about how long would it take etc etc (any relevant info would be helpful).

That seems pretty slow, but the tank can pull like a mother, and with the shaman slow things die pretty quick.</t>','08a927af8192b07744b0b6ce5e0c9b0e',0,'','318y00br',1,0,'',0,0,0,1,0,'',0),(259,105,35,2,0,'50.25.122.79',1506420335,0,1,1,1,1,'','Re: Pushing for 60 need asssistance','<t>At your level, 30ish, go to Dalnir. Do the zonein. Pull from first few rooms, is incredible exp there, Haven\'t seen anything as good for PL\'ing yet. Then late 30\'s, or earlier if you think you can stand it, go to Keasora. First dropdown on the way to the library is an awesome pull spot, prob 15+ mobs without ever getting all the way to the library. Nothing runs but the \"floaters\" which means they die on your DS, just hit em once. I took many friends there, its good up to late 40\'s easy, from 45-49 it took a TOTAL of 5.5 hours for my dru to PL a tank there, but that is a different PL than a shammie. Every skill maxxed, as I was fighting 4 mobs constant, Def was the first up =)). Low 40\'s move down to Xalgoz lair, BTW. At 50, I got great exp solo in Dulak, but at 51 the hammer fell and it turned to very very old cheese, i.e. it SUCKED.

I should know since I have a level 60 Paladin and it wasnt til I was in the late 50s when I wanted to start working on my 1hb, and my piercing skills since they were both in the teens. So it was a bear getting them up to the 200s. As a warrior I have made sure that I have gathered some good equipment for my journeys so here is a list of what I have in the way of gear.<br/>\n<br/>\n1 Handed Slash<br/>\nDefiance<br/>\nCenti Longsword<br/>\n<br/>\nPiercing<br/>\nShimmering Partisan<br/>\nEmbalmers Skinning Knife<br/>\n<br/>\n1 Handed Blunt<br/>\nGuard Captians Mallet<br/>\nBed Leg Club<br/>\n<br/>\n2 Handed Slash<br/>\nHave another sword just cant remember name<br/>\nWidebladed Greatsword<br/>\n<br/>\n2 Handed Blunt<br/>\nGranite Faced Grinder<br/>\n<br/>\nMy equipment for haste is Runed Branded Girdle. As for the rest of my AC its a long list but its not too bad. Not spectatular but I have high hopes that once I hit 46 I will be equiping all of my Cazic-Thule smithed Cultural armor I have. So that will totally help my AC and hp department. Now as for my comment about skills. I currently got to 31 last night and Im hoping I can get 2 more levels tonight. I think my relative push is 2 levels a day since I only get about 4 hours to play when I come home from work. Now weekends. STAND BACK!! As for all my skills each of them are maxed at 155 for my level. This includes Double Attack, Dual Wield, Defense, 1HS, 2HS, 1HB, 2HB, and Piercing. My slam is at 120, and my kick is at 101. When I am usually attacking I am constantly hitting Taunt, Sense Heading, and Slam. When I am normally fighting mobs that are not casters I will use kick because I want to keep that skill up when it becomes a stun at 51 I believe. Now since Ive played a Paladin I know how to pull with him, since I love the Pacify line of spells. As for a warrior it is a little different and I do hope to pick up those skills later on down the road. I do know that once I get in the 50s I will be grouping mostly for experience and if I cant get a group I will duo with my shaman. Again thanks for the info Keane.<br/>\n<br/>\nBaruch the Bastard <E>:)</E> <br/>\n<br/>\nCurrently Im looking for a place to go in the low 30s. I am leaning toward OT, but currently Im running around EW. But it would be really easy to hit OT and try that out. Actually the more I think about it I feel that might be a good area to go. As I said earlier to Keane the skillz are good but thanks for the encouragement.<br/>\n<br/>\nRaggrim<br/>\n<br/>\nI was planning on hitting Lower Guk for some experience once I hit around the late 40s. I did it when I was a paladin from 51 to 54 and the experience even though it was a grind was still not bad. I dont know the full exp per hour bit but I do know that zone very well. It should not be too difficult for me to set up show and go to town. Its too bad though that I cant use my Shamans lizzy mount in dungeons its SO helpful when to med. Thanks for the luck too. <E>:)</E> <br/>\n<br/>\nNuzum<br/>\n<br/>\nMan Im stoked you are in the exact same position Im in. As for hitting CoM Im more than eager to head over there and get the experience rolling, but my question is when would that be a good idea? 35, 37?? Could you give me an idea. That zone is rather out of the way, and I want to make sure that when I head over there I dont get trounced to early. Because if I can find my niche, believe me I WILL USE IT!! And if I can push to 46 quickly that just means UBER ARMOR baby!! Thanks for the input man it will be greatly used.<br/>\n<br/>\nWerekin<br/>\n<br/>\nNow you offer some interesting ideas Werekin. When I was playing my Paladin LONG before Luclin, PoP, or LoY came out that was the zone to play in. Had some good memories there when I was in my 30s with my Paladin. I will say this, I might head over to Dalnir and check it out if OT turns out to be too difficult or just not working out. Since I have to two box its not easy at times, but I can say this. IVE NOT DIED YET AND IM 31. Cant say the same about my shaman friend but with 90% rezzes on my Paladin its easy to clean up the mess and my shaman only loses 1% exp from the rez so no big loss there. I do have access to a druid as well so I might try out your tactics in Kaesora with a druid thorning my warrior while I just stay alive. Very good ideas worth trying out.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell guys I want to thank each of you. This was very informative and leads me to play a Mighty warrior in hopes of Smiting my enemies and bringing more glory to those that worship Cazic-Thule.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nNelivikk \"Bob\" BoneCrusher</r>','713254eb92c7ff606f2462040cffa440',0,'','1ocxh33d',1,0,'',0,0,0,1,0,'',0),(261,105,35,2,0,'50.25.122.79',1506420366,0,1,1,1,1,'','Re: Pushing for 60 need asssistance','<t>Neli,<br/>\n<br/>\nGreat to hear that info.

If so head there at 30, you can burn through to 38 easy in a few nights at the zone in. Other area\'s of interest are the stables (good at low 40\'s to high 40\'s), the temple, only if you pull with the shaman until the warrior gets past 50, bad agro spot, (the gazeebos way in the back man that xp is damn good) but most of those things are low 40\'s in level so I would wait until you get to mid 40\'s to tank them, the phantoms suck.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne thing I have now I wish i had when I was doing my PL was Stoicism, get this spell and use it.

The key for BoT is found by collecting pieces in PoS.

Also, BoT is primarly 63+ especially for a tank. I was keyed at lvl 61 but didn\'t find a group there as tank until 64. With the new flag raid feature if someone did a raid so large that you could fit in the raid flagless, you COULD potentially get the BoT flag w/o PoV/S flag. But even if you did, finding groups in BoT isn\'t the easiest thing. The good thing is that PoV/S and BoT are the two flags that you don\'t need a big guild for.

Well we kill them all pretty easy took us about 20 minutes to kill those 4 sense we already had that area cleared. Ranger tells me ahhh Cazic Thule isn\'t on track.

If you don\'t own a bow, make this a top priority, any damn bow is better than nothing.

The flip side is, they run faster, there is nowhere to zone to, and you can\'t outswim them either. However, if you have j boots and can levitate, if you get a bad pull, you can run away over the water until they give up, then camp to clear aggro.

It\'s an outdoor zone though, so not much of an XP bonus on the zone, velks is much better per kill.

These should be used to practice assisting and killing drakes in a certain order. <br/>\n<br/>\nOnce WAVE 4 starts, things start to get serious. Two warders spawn, which result in a total of TWENTY TWO drakes when all is said and done. Even after doing a great job of assisting and tanking adds, we ended up getting shafted int he end when Templars spawned during the second chain cycle. It is my recommendation to keep the second chain trigger tanked fur the duration of the Ring Event or until we get spare time to kill it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen WAVE 5 starts, the ring trigger, whom is in the room alone, will DA tank the templars while an enchanter will Wind of Tashania them. Cutting this debuff out immediately at the start will let our shamans malo + slow the FLURRY drakes with less resists, saving a lot of lives and getting the mobs slowed faster. This will be set up for every wave from this point on.</t>','72a18d26353f49fba1ab74a3fde25405',0,'','vcjis4kb',1,0,'',0,0,0,1,0,'',0),(431,131,35,2,0,'50.25.122.79',1506425040,0,1,1,1,1,'','Grummus','<t>How hard is he? whats his AA?

I didn\'t tell my guild I was doing anything different, and I had aggro from start to finish. Fennin, like Rallos, is really easy to hold aggro on.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe non-melee damage there was 100% damage shields. On the first example which was about a week ago, I didn\'t have a mage DS for whatever reason. The second was Saturday, and I did have a Mage DS.<br/>\n<br/>\nEvery Fennin fight I use the same buffs: Virtue, BSS, Fo7, CoR, SotP, VQ, Unfailing Reverence, DI, VoT, Grim Aura. The first time I happened to forget to get a mage DS, which happens from time to time.<br/>\n<br/>\nI suppose high AC makes evasive a lot more viable. It seems to be that Evasive is only really bad when you are taking lots of maximum hits, since the chance that you take back to back max hits is high. Since I only took 8 max hits out of 111, they were probably fairly evenly spaced. If I was taking say 20 or so max hits out of 111, I think it\'s more unlikey to survive while evasive.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other deal here is the effect of defensive versus the effect of evasive on the actual damage being dealt. Since Fennin hits 1024 minimum in ANY case, defensive takes a 1962 hit and mitigates it down to 1481, effectively reducing max damage by 25%, and min damage by 3%. On the other hand, evasive doesn\'t really care about how hard the mob hits, it just cuts 25% of the hits out of the equation entirely. <br/>\n<br/>\nDefensive did nothing for me on the 55 minimum hits I took in the first example. Evasive reduced the number of hits (including min hits) by a flat 25%, making for a much better overall reduction in damage.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, I think as I go forward tanking mobs that tend to min hit me a lot for serious damage, I\'ll go evasive much more often than defensive. On mobs that rip through my armor, I\'ll go defensive.</t>','523e7d2f4da9c9d6e23aacdc125793f7',0,'','3kadfvvr',1,0,'',0,0,0,1,0,'',0),(477,139,35,2,0,'50.25.122.79',1506426565,0,1,1,1,1,'','Re: Here ya go, Solinar - Fennin Ro, defensive vs. evasive','<t>Nice parses.

With the amount of times you get hit as a main tank, the probability that this *doesn\'t* ever happen isn\'t especially high, though still high.

The Giants too have many beings in their service, Ogres, Trolls, and unfortunately even Northmen like myself have been hired into the service of the Kromzek.

Depending on your levels you will need 1 to 2 maybe even 3 groups if you are trying in the low 50s... but if your under 55 then I wouldn\'t try it. The big problem with the SSS is getting there, you have to drop down this well with a couple mobs some of wich are chanters. They mez, they charm, and if you don\'t resist then it ends realy fast. I went down there at 56 or 57 with mr at 200-250 or so (120 base with bard song and some other buffs) I got mezed fairly quickly, bard got charmed.... almost a total wipe. Mez broke on me long enough to start heading back out only to kill the bard on reposite damage. Bard took out the wizzy pretty quick. Anyway the cleric and I made it and we did the CR for the group.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you still want to go just carefully pull the well. You will want a bard for the MR, Cleric (of course) a chanter for adds, because you will get them and there are some pretty tight spots, A wizzy or druid for the succor (easiest way to get there is to succor across SG, and you want the port in to CS to begin with), and then a damage dealer (rogue or monk for FD pulls, whatever...) and includeing you thats one full group. It is easy to get bards to this camp because some drums drop off the SSS (i am pretty sure about this) and they all want those drums for supper fast selos.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for the SSS? well hardest part is actually trying to find it up. After the CR we did it right, slow and steady. Got in and camped the spot for a couple hours, just wasnt up. I heard you can track from the succor spot. Don\'t know if thats ranger track, druid or bard, (as in: in range of the ranger but not the bard...) but you can try. Other thing is make sure everyone has a perma EB item or at least a bunch of summoned eb stones.

Also it\'s a good idea to use creative camera angles to check if there is a wanderer in the pit before you split the two wurms. If there are two wurms up, *always* pull red ones first (if you pull a white one, it may gate, which will aggro the other wurm and any roamers in the pit). <br/>\n<br/>\nIf there are two whites, you\'ll have to pull one and do your best to stop it from gating. <br/>\n<br/>\nOnce you have the pit clear, you can start pulling from outside of it. If you have a non-FD puller, definetly go through the left door (mobs are spaced farther apart). The right door has mobs closer together. Don\'t go through the middle door (Dozekar\'s room). You should just pull back to the HoT door area when you\'re first starting out. Once you get more comfortable with the halls, you can actually do circuits through them (which will result in faster pulls and less puller deaths). <br/>\n<br/>\nThe mobs to watch out for as someone said are blue drakes and white wurms. They gate. Also watch out for the dragonflies (a glimmering drake or something). They gate and are immune to magic (use disease slow on them). They are also druids so dispell their damage shields. The other mobs to watch out for would be some of the stronger wyverns (especially a vehement wyvern). They run fast, some of them quad for 330. Some are rogues and backstab for over 500. Some are SKs and will HT and try to dark you. They also tend to be more difficult to slow - you may need to go defensive or evasive on them until slow lands. That\'s what we had to do when we first started doing HoT, though it\'s easier with some of the improved shaman and druid heals (and increased levels for slowers of course). <br/>\n<br/>\nCH chains should not be needed for the armor dropping mobs there. Bards are nice but not absolutely necessary. At 60+ with 150 resists or so the AEs didn\'t do very much damage to me (so this was just with Seasons druid buff).

Don\'t wait for them to wipe, let the mob regen while they attempt to get back for CR, then engage once it\'s full. Just walk away and find something else to do, and ask the other guild to let you know if they wipe and don\'t plan to attempt the mob again.

Earlier my further playing was more based on pride about what I had achieved, since those changes it is pride about what I achieved as well as about what I can contribute with my class skills when properly used.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe certainly nicest change was the upgrades in the ability to \"tank\" for my class. Not only do we have a real role in a group now (and a nice backup role if the \"tank spot\" is taken), groupleaders are also able to choose from three possible tanks now instead of one as before. While Warriors can take a maior beating and turn spells like Complete Heal or the new Dru/Shm heals more efficient, Knights have a higher taunt ability to reduce the need of spread heals, mana expensive fast heals or group heals (Paladins even can take over the groupheals themselfs).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe differences in HP, AC, Mitigation and Avoidance between Warriors and Knights are in place, and not so big that groups would still choose Warriors over Knights (while other way around neither, both of which is very good designed from your side). The difference between Warriors and Knights when taunting is yet too big though. So, while clearly not asking for a \"nerf\" of the Knight classes or spell agro in general, I\'d like to ask you to slightely improve the aggro generating skills of Warriors. Not nerf but improvement for Warriors because most players of Casters and Priests, as well as offensive melees love to live and perform at their best most. Examples for not living and performing at ones best, related to the tank not being able to hold agro properly:<br/>\n- a Shaman that gets a beating on every spell: Slow they cast<br/>\n- a Ranger that has to turn off autoattack even though using spell: Jolting Blades every 15 seconds for a few seconds<br/>\n- Druids and Wizards sitting around and casting Spell: Ensnare (or similar) 45 seconds after the fight began while also not being able to cast direct Damage spells any earlier<br/>\n- Necromancers not being able to use their damage over time potential fully from fear of being wasted by xp-zones inhabiting mobs hitting fast for over 600 per blow<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI have made a few thoughts about how this topic could be adjusted as well - as I guess you get tons of feedbacks, emails and other submissions about it from many, many players:<br/>\n<br/>\n- The general Kick skill should have added a Agro increasing component which equals the Paladin spell: Stun. With that Warriors, and other kick enabled classes, could taunt a little bit better (without putting the other tanks into the dust) and still be able to choose when to use that taunt and when not to. They don\'t loose much DPS when not kicking because another Warrior is MT for example.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Maybe a nice gimmick would be to have an class AA skill called something aline of \"Leathal Defamation\", creating a hotbutton, clicking which makes the targeted mob (caps at level 65) perma focused on the Warrior, reuse time as LoH or HT, with a PoP AA in 3 levels that reduces the reuse time by half at level 3 (as Paladins have for LoH)...<br/>\n<br/>\n- The Proc of the hate-producing part of the proc of the 2HS version of the Warrior epic could be improved to be similar to Knight epics.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Several 1HS, 1HB and 1HP weapons that are flagged \"Warrior only\" could be introduced in the level 55+ game that are either focused to generate Hate but have a relatively low taunt-factor, as well as weapons that clearly have low taunt but higher DPS. While being forced to maximize their HP more than any other class, it is the only option for gear choices of the Warrior class to go for taunt or DPS.<br/>\n<br/>\n- A rather fun AA (and not necessarily related to taunt) would be a PoP AA skill for Warriors of level 64 or 65 that turns Frenzy into an mob like Enrage with still allowing them to do those nifty crippling blows, but else auto-reposting every landing melee-hit. This ability should last 5 seconds max or until the char being healed and then (if the Warrior still lives) going on as the normal Frenzy. This class-skill should be delivered with one level for 9 points.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith kind regards and thank you for your entertaining and fun game,<br/>\n<br/>\nLady Shayariel Val\'Aragil<br/>\nHigh Elven Crusader<br/>\nLevel 62<br/>\nMithaniel Marr server<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S.: My final decision to post this here derived from a long talk with several Knights, Warriors and other representants of other classes on the server I am playing on. The decision to post it here instead of sending an email to the Verant Interactive customer relationship executives came from my trust of them reading this board as well as other classes\' boards and the desire to have players of this fine class adding their comments as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nEdit: I was informed on my server that it is the reason that Warriors\' disadvantage for their higher HP/AC/Mitig/Avoid is that everyone in the group/raid has to \"let\" the Warrior keep agro. This in opposition to Knights keeping the agro, letting everyone play to their max, but needing more heals. I knew that and it is basically right - fair is discussable. So please do not read the suggestions at the end of the post as all-to-max-extend solutions, but rather as either-or (except the Enrage AA, which should rather be a class defining AA like Slay Undead for example).</t>','95b5c30fb84616d447d0e9bff41d99f4',0,'','3erbhp5o',1,0,'',0,0,0,1,0,'',0),(685,195,3,52,0,'198.86.16.250',1506527861,0,1,1,1,1,'','Re: Dear developer team: One knight\'s view of Warriors.','<t>Nice post</t>','3d584830bcaefe282a260c12d18ca42b',0,'','2vtwfo2z',1,0,'',0,0,0,1,0,'',0),(686,195,3,52,0,'198.86.16.250',1506527876,0,1,1,1,1,'','Re: Dear developer team: One knight\'s view of Warriors.','<t>I had to edit some part: Please do not assume that what I suppose as measurements should be given all to a max extend. The additions, no matter in what mixture, should not bring Warriors to an equal taunt level of Knights.<br/>\nAnd all that also means of course that the game content (revamps, new expensions, patches) doesn\'t get balanced around a certain class mix in a group (e.g. mobs that can\'t harm melee but /DT casters and need supreme taunting in an entire expansion or mobs that hit that hard and fast and are that focused on the the HP-fatest person that the 1000 HP of the Warrior makes it forced to use them in an xp camp).<br/>\n<br/>\nTank balance is a very difficult balance, especially as it has been officially closed as being finished. Still there needs to be a slight (please stress: slight) raise in taunt skills - OR a vast improvement in raid skills (e.g. an AA that is comparable to Slay Undead, but works against all kind of mobs that are level 75 and up).<br/>\n<br/>\nAbout the Enrage AA: It doesn\'t necessarily need to be 100% Mitigation of hits, a Warrior being able to reduce the dmg taken down to 33% while getting an riposte-attack for any hit he takes, would still be way cool.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor any wondering: I fully support class balance and I see that Warriors are a bit out of whack now. So I support your causes. I will not support those though, that ask to get improved to a level pre-melee patches. That is too much. Every tank class (War/SK/Pal) deserves a 33% chance to get the tank spot in a group, throughout the levelrange and from new player to uber. This is meant including the various preferences of players, it doesn\'t help if a class gets a selfonly instant CH with 1 sec cast time, 1 sec recast if people value the shine of the other class\' epic more or their surplus in HP, spells, whatever...<br/>\n<br/>\nShay</t>','c30984a36c3d15d0cf1e92a49eec1311',0,'','2dwy038z',1,0,'',0,0,0,1,0,'',0),(687,195,3,52,0,'198.86.16.250',1506527886,0,1,1,1,1,'','Re: Dear developer team: One knight\'s view of Warriors.','<t>Shay, although I appreciate your post to address the taunt issue, and rightly so it is needed, Warriors pre 53. do not have a 33% chance of getting into a group.

Check this out:<br/>\n<br/>\nOur guild gets in SSRA hearing the XTC and the HP is up. Both are easy mobs for our guild if we have 35 for XTC and 45 for the HP. Very very small chance of failure.<br/>\n<br/>\nGuild B is already in the zone and calling that HP and XTC are camped. We talk to them and say we will take one and they will take the other. We agreed on the HP and they were going to take XTC.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe run up and find out that Guild B is in the Com 2 area and cant get past the locked door (Guild B is like \"WTF? Rogue picklock doesnt work here?\" :rolleyes ) Anyway, they follow us on in as best they can and COH the rest.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, we didn\'t try and trick them into getting into a locked area and asked them to leave. They just followed us into the HP CC room (the jail) and then sat there. We made preps to engage the HP but guild B never moved into the XTC room to get our of our way. After waiting 30 minutes for them to do something, we moved into XTC room and killed him. We left the HP for them but admittedly that was a harder mob and the add mobs wiped their asses with Guild B.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo yea, I guess we \"jumped\" Guild B technically but who is the @#%$? We made an agreement that was contingent upon Guild B and our guild not interferring with each other - yet they wouldnt leave the CC room and go to \"their\" mob. We also let them into an area they had no business being in since they didnt have a key (we didnt know that or we would have sent them key farming) but after bitching a little we decided to drop that issue. And finally, we left them a just-as-nice mob to deal with. <br/>\n<br/>\nSeems we bent over backward to help this guild but in order to be a \"nice guy\" in Everquest some people expect you to bend over forward (pants down of course).<br/>\n__________________________________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n<br/>\nSmohg - Keep Hope Alive<br/>\n<br/>\nStuff that nobody else wanted</t>','3f6acba0bd72fa066b3bfb513a99353f',0,'','1j2ia2w2',1,0,'',0,0,0,1,0,'',0),(693,186,37,51,0,'68.61.123.121',1506527943,0,1,1,1,1,'','Re: MOB thats has anouther guild on it what do you do','<t>Re: post	  #14	[-]<br/>\n avatar<br/>\n<br/>\nPosts: 0<br/>\nMar 22 03 2:23 AM<br/>\nReply Quote More<br/>\nMy Recent Posts<br/>\n/shrug<br/>\n<br/>\nit really depends on your server i guess. if you have 5+ guilds all competing for the same target, simply backing off every time will end up gimping your guild. but i guess slowing down things like your guild\'s POP progression doesn\'t matter as much to some guilds as others.</t>','8ccb21cea5d5afa7167add658bf19d4a',0,'','zi7fu216',1,0,'',0,0,0,1,0,'',0),(694,195,3,52,0,'198.86.16.250',1506527949,0,1,1,1,1,'','Re: Dear developer team: One knight\'s view of Warriors.','<t>The problem I forsee, is that once again you are proposing to fix our problems with equipment.

Improving both too much will make Knights obsolete in groups. If placing some of those items with maybe up to 160 raw HP and weapons with agro proc in PoP highest tier zones and some others with maybe 80, 90 raw HP or a lesser high agro proc in the relatively easy to access zones (which maybe will be revamped to fit that level range soon anyways) for the people that are 55 to 60 in PoD/I/N like zones, there should be no further discrepancy from ubers to non-ubers. Of course Warriors in uber guilds need to get some more absolute HP (while staying equal to Knights when comparing relative, maybe relatively 15% (??) more HP than Knights throughout the game).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe problem is that, if VI increases the HP/AC to be constant 15% over Knights\' HP/AC (and avoid/mitig as well) AND their taunt to be closer to ours, Knights will be pointless to chose for the tank spot, as Warriors have a too large advantage in efficiency in that core ability (Core abilities in EQ are in my eyes: tanking, healing, crowd controling, DPS, buffing unique and usefull buffs). Core abilities should always be fillable with about 3 different classes while being able to achieve the very same things in the same time with any combination of healer/tank/cc/dps/buffer.<br/>\nA combo War/Cle plus four others should not get more xp/hour than e.g. a combo SK/Dru plus four others, the only difference should be tactics needed. If one combo gets indeed less xp/h than another then the secondary skills of that combi are too bad (assuming equal gear, equal skill of players and so on).<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom the further discussion with people on my server, I think that Warriors mainly need a small Taunt upgrade for xp groups, and a stronger, and more defining skill that /disc def for raids, e.g. an AA that allows them to each mitigate AND avoid 4% more dmg from mobs that are lvl 75 at skill level 1, 71 at skill level 2 and 66 at skill level 3, CS3 and CA3 as requirements for this level 61 or 65 PoP skill, or even Class skill - just as an example. Together with the overall but small Taunt upgrade, this should define this class as the only real raid tank while not disabling Knights to tank the non-non-slowable boss mobs, which should be possible with some more efford for the case that a guild has no Warrior online, pure non-slowable endgame bossmobs (which I was told are about 2% in game) should always require a Warrior and nothing else.<br/>\nThis raid role should offset the Knights\' soloing advantage, in xp groups both Warriors and Knights should be equally efficient, and would be, at least with this changes...<br/>\n<br/>\nShay</t>','b4ebafdb87be6da6d922a984cc87bec0',0,'','2x6z8d14',1,0,'',0,0,0,1,0,'',0),(700,186,37,51,0,'68.61.123.121',1506527985,0,1,1,1,1,'','Re: MOB thats has anouther guild on it what do you do','<t>Re: RE:	  #18	[-]<br/>\n avatar<br/>\n<br/>\nPosts: 0<br/>\nMar 26 03 11:42 PM<br/>\nReply Quote More<br/>\nMy Recent Posts<br/>\nQuote:<br/>\nbut do you gimp the mob at 40% life or wait til it regens to full hp?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nmost mobs regen to full health as soon as everyone\'s dead. so unless you actually start attacking the mob before the guild tryin it is all dead (which is a warnable offense), it will usually be full HP right away.</t>','c6f55c39928108afc757245ae8881e04',0,'','3nzwx9w7',1,0,'',0,0,0,1,0,'',0),(701,195,3,52,0,'198.86.16.250',1506527992,0,1,1,1,1,'','Re: Dear developer team: One knight\'s view of Warriors.','<t>actually the cleric community was more or less split down the middle on the subject.

If I\'m grouping with a Pally... you can forget about me holding aggro, it\'s rediculous. I\'m using a Red Epic/Clearmetal Windblade combo, there is NO reason I should not be able to hld aggro with this. It\'s fekking retarded you almost HAVE to have an EB weapon to hold aggro. Taunt does not work for crap, you get top of the aggro list +1, then when Paly_01 or Ranger_01 or whatever_01 does just the smallest bit more dmg than you you have lost aggro yet again. Make taunt have some lasting effect. Make it top of the agro list +50 or +100 or something.<br/>\nAnother gripe I have is with AET. I think it needs to be addressed just like I think regular taunt needs to be addressed. Example. Say your pulling for your group, you get 2 adds so you have 3 mobs inc to camp.

All 3 mobs are now on the cleric. Clerc targets themselves and starts to heal. You pop AET, now you have all 3 mobs back on you where they are supposed to be. Well, remember the cleric targeting themself and starting to heal he damage they took? Well that heal lands now. 3_mobs_01 say wtf! Cleric is healing themself! KEEL! Now you have once again lost aggro and the cleric is dying a painfull death. WTF is up with that? I spent 5 aa points to have guarenteed aggro off everyone in my party and this is the crap I get? grrrr Now AET does have it\'s uses and has saed my groups ass many times.

A 51 Warrior in full Thurg quest armor with epics is also better than a 52 Paladin in Armor of Ro (midlevel quest) with a Wurmslayer and Shield of Mistmoore.<br/>\n<br/>\nSaying that no oone cares about Knight mana when they tank is as ridiculous as not taking them as tank at all, stating they cannot tank in general, or as leaving a 60 Druid in Sebilis at zin looking for a Cleric, having the opinion that Druids aren\'t sufficient healers in Sebilis (my non-uber 58 Druid healed in Juggs already, and our guild isn\'t even in NToV or ST yet).<br/>\nA Knight\'s taunt is based on their spells (for Paladins: Stuns) and their weapon procs. All Warriors I talked to were the opinion that tauntin with 2 1HS works better than with 1 2HS if both are procless and of comparable DPS. Else there would only be the taunt skill ehich caps lower as the one from Warriors for us, and the AA skills, where Warriors have AET and Paladins a 30 sec Stun - I wonder if that would be sufficient to outtaunt you.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn raids anyways, the Knights are held to not get agro there and they manage it if they aren\'t total nerds or tremendously better geared than the Warrior. If that would be the case though, the RL should rather take the Knight as MT anyways, or would you - as another, but similar example - take a 50 War over a 65 SK as MT, a 34 Cle over a 58 Dru as MH, even if the two in both examples each have similar gear?<br/>\n<br/>\nShay</t>','c56f795a4eb38ba7c837a813f5e822aa',0,'','2w2sx44k',1,0,'',0,0,0,1,0,'',0),(722,200,37,51,0,'68.61.123.121',1506528319,0,1,1,1,1,'','more help plz!!!','<t>Lead	[-]<br/>\n avatar<br/>\n<br/>\nPosts: 9<br/>\nJun 3 03 10:38 AM<br/>\nReply Quote More<br/>\nMy Recent Posts<br/>\nTAGS : None<br/>\n<br/>\nis there any other piece of armor or accessory that will have regen on it ?<br/>\nis there a charm or anearring or something??</t>','7416ae4e5af5fc9591244ea32aea56f1',0,'','2xqxnzed',1,0,'',0,0,0,1,0,'',0),(723,195,3,52,0,'198.86.16.250',1506528327,0,1,1,1,1,'','Re: Dear developer team: One knight\'s view of Warriors.','<t>Quick and simple:<br/>\n<br/>\nProblems with taunt are its high rate of failure and its low amount of hate boost.<br/>\n<br/>\nLower the fail rate and up the added aggro or maybe make it like evade as in a failed taunt still adds +x hate instead of the nothing it adds now.</t>','ad07cbb66454db67d5f5b3c3448b7a11',0,'','3pjbyfso',1,0,'',0,0,0,1,0,'',0),(724,195,3,52,0,'198.86.16.250',1506528337,0,1,1,1,1,'','Re: Dear developer team: One knight\'s view of Warriors.','<t>Quote:<br/>\n<br/>\nEvery tank class (War/SK/Pal) deserves a 33% chance to get the tank spot in a group.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI respectfully disagree with that. Why, you, a Knight (or a Shadow Knight or whatever), a HYBRID class should have the same chances as me, a SPECIALIST (or supposet to be) ?. As an HYBRID, it sounds quite normal to me that you sacrifice some pure-tanking power for magical abilities, that I don\'t get and will never get.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen i created this character, i didnt want to bother with magic, and decided to play a DE mostly to fix the nightvision problem. As a pure specialist of toe to toe combat, i was happy to have massive HP, dual wield, disciplines, best AC and so. And now ? Now, Paladins and Shadow Knights are at least as good as I am. 2 handers damage was improved, so we got basically the same DPS. Through AA and insane stuff, hybrids can match the HP of a warrior. With their spells, hybrids outtant a warrior whenever they want. They got the same AC. And they still have spells...<br/>\n<br/>\nHonestly, is that FAIR ? Maybe I\'m just jealous, but well, if SKs and Paladins get enhancements, why dont warriors get enhancements as well ? I just think that an hybrid should never, never become a warrior with spells, that\'s just insane. Who would play a warrior, if a paladin can become a tank equally good, but with LoH, stuns, roots, rez, heals, and such crap ? The only thing I have to put in the balance against hybrids is that poor \"/disc defensive\" thing. I dont even speak about solo or duel abilities, or such useful things like FD or buff capacities, wich I cannot even afford to dream about.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think if Verant made the hybrids better, they got to make the warrior better aswell. They give ND and crits to other melees ? Okay, no prob. But in that case, multiply the natural amount of HP of warriors. Give them much better weapon skills. Give them more DPS. Give them more disciplines, or improve seriously the ones they already have. I dont want improvements through the too easy \"warrior only item\" way. I dont want to be \"slightly\" improved, i want a major enhancement, something that hybrids dont have and would give to groups a serious reason to take a warrior instead of an hybrid for the MT role.<br/>\n<br/>\nI dont think that such enhacement would unbalance anything. It just would get the warrior his true place back. The role of hybrids should not to be the MAIN tanks, it should to be the BACKUP tanks. After all, the group can still need the non-melee abilities of hybrids, what should justify their existence. When you cannot find a cleric, you take a druid or a shaman right ? That should be the same with warriors and hybrids, as it was before VI destroyed the edge we had on them in terms of pure melee abilities.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, just my 2cp.

Verant doesn\'t want to give us better taunt because they don\'t think the game would be exciting if the mob was just beating on the warrior all day while the cleric healed him/her. I think this interpretation of \"fun\" is geared more towards the high raid level game though... Because I know and I\'ve SEEN shadow knights and paladins keep near perma-aggro on mobs in experience giving groups. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe problem lies with the taunt ability itself. Even if it doesn\'t fail, there still lies the problem of \"keeping\" aggro. I have both AE taunt and taunt. AE taunt is on a 15 minute recycle, which I can lower to around 10 minutes [not worth it atm I think, pretty much on the bottom of my PoP AA list]. I use both taunts frequently, as they become available to me. I get the mobs attention, but a second later, the mob goes right back to someone else [until I proc]. Taunt brings me to the top of the hate list, but it doesn\'t accumulate. Once I\'m up there, there\'s nowhere else for me to go but down. I have to press taunt again... And again... While the mob is bouncing all over the place. I mean, I CAN get it back by pressing taunt. But that doesn\'t guarantee that I keep it. If a mob gets off me for a few seconds or more, that\'s more than enough time to wipe out a chanter or cleric. I\'ve seen it happen... Especially in PoS against those giants. Of course they tend to FD me too... So it\'s a bit different.<br/>\n<br/>\nPaladins and Shadowknights have a way of not only getting to the top of the hate list, but maintaining aggro for long periods of time. I\'ve seen shamans throw malo\'s and slows... Enchanters nuke and tash... And yet the shadow knight would still maintain aggro. And if he/she loses it, they get it back in an instant. Very rarely have I seen them lose aggro for long periods of time. At times, I even have problems with SIT aggro getting on top of the hate list over me! It\'s a bit ridiculous. I\'m not saying all warriors have the same problems, but I\'m saying that once a mob is pulled, it takes a while for me to get the DPS and procs to maintain sufficient aggro. A shaman or enchanter slowing in the beginning of the fight might be fatal for them. But if they don\'t, it might be fatal for me. For a shadow knight and paladin however, one or two spells keeps that mob on them from start to finish.</t>','ca6ecfd389940c6b094d01c82bacebb8',0,'','2fvg895b',1,0,'',0,0,0,1,0,'',0),(727,195,3,52,0,'198.86.16.250',1506528360,0,1,1,1,1,'','Re: Dear developer team: One knight\'s view of Warriors.','<t>Quote:<br/>\nI respectfully disagree with that.

Thus they must have the same rights as well as the same chances to accomplish the same things as Warriors - at least in xp group setups if assuming that Warriors shine more on raids and Knights shine more soloing.<br/>\nI said \"accomplish the same\" so far, now I will add that they shouldn\'t be able to get it done by using the same tools.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe idea of a Warrior should be like:<br/>\nTanks with most HP/AC/Mitigation/Avoidance, thus can take the hardest beating. The biggest heals of healer classes are most efficient when used on a Warrior. On the other hand, the Warrior looses agro sometimes (lesser overall taunt) and makes the healers having to use inefficienter heals on other party members.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe idea of Paladins should be like:<br/>\nTanks with 80% HP/AC/Mitigation/Avoidance compared to Warriors, thus can take lesser beating, but can keep agro nearly 100% so there is no need for heals on other party members. The healers need more fast, inefficient heals to add to the big pointheals though. Paladins add self heals to safe healers\' mana and use Stuns to lower the dmg over time of mobs, making less heals needed.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe idea of Shadow Knights should be like:<br/>\nCan\'t really comment on them as they don\'t function quite like Paladins, should maybe have a bit higher DPS than Warriors though which should be purely derived from their spells. Only a guess, remember.<br/>\n<br/>\nThose are the very ideas of the 3 tank classes as I recall them. Those definitions are broken though from VI\'s try to balance the PvE game back in the days by adding high resists and even immunities, level caps on spells, but no nearly melee imune mobs or even mobs that are highly affectable by taunts and spells, but not meleeable at all. If spells were as efficient overall as pure melee is, than I would be a very strong supporter of those ideas being reinstituted.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nEQ does not support versatility too much, and even less in situations were skilled people play. That makes combinations of skills very difficult as if a skill is weaker than 80% of the specialist class\' skill degree, it is useless and a class will not be invited to groups. One 80% skill and one 20% skill is not a 100% class because of this lack of versatility un-support.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are only 6 spots for groups which \"require\" a certain role in it each, each class must excell in one of those roles, if not as specialist then at least with their added benefit/skills:<br/>\n- Tank<br/>\n- Healer<br/>\n- Crowd Control<br/>\n- Persistent melee DPS<br/>\n- Fast spellbased DPS<br/>\n- fill up with any class<br/>\n<br/>\nUtility (Gates/Buffs/Debuffs/...) is distributed amongst the first five classes usually or turned unneeded from the sheer specialists power. If added to the specialists, it makes a group superefficient (which is momentarily seen as the \"normal, wellbalanced\" group).<br/>\n<br/>\nFor the Spellbased DPS we can choose from 2 classes, Wizards and Magicians, one is missing.<br/>\nFor the Melee DPS we can choose from 3 classes or even 4, Rangers, Rogues, Monks and maybe Beast Lords, and it is quite good that we have such a high variety to choose from as it is faster to fill up the group and actually start to play.<br/>\nFor Crowd Control we can not really choose, the gap between Enchanters and the other two classes (Bard and Necromancers) is just too big, even though they may be able to do the job in some lesser spots.<br/>\nFor healers we can choose from one (Cleric), in lesser spots from 2 more classes (Druids and Shamans).<br/>\nFor tanks we can choose from 3 classes equally now, whoever shows up first is being taken.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo clarify: I talk about pickup xp groups, not family type guilds, uberguilds, personal preferences (e.g. healers that are too lazy tp press F1, F3-6 with having the tank in F2 spot) or the like. I do not talk about raids nor soloing neither, that area of the game is the area where specialists must shine with versatiles having a secondary role (just to be allowed to participate). Soloing is the area where versatility classes should shine on the other hand, as it is not yet as xp efficient for most of them as grouping and not as loot attractive as raids.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo get back to above: As I see it, a groupleader must be able to choose from 3 classes (3 would be perfect, about 3 would be realistic) for each of the 5 categories, which he really should have to fill, e.g. being able to replace a Wizard with a Monk any time of the day is just plain mean / unfair / unbalanced. <br/>\nEach of the 3 classes within a categorie should be able to handle the job that leads to the same goal, but with varying toys and strategies.<br/>\nOn the Tank side:<br/>\n(having 100% Taunt as efficient as it is now, it is basically replacable with other player\'s skills though, so it is not a true tank skill)<br/>\nWarriors have 100% HP/AC/M./A. - 100% DPS - 100% Taunt - no other skills that turn them into a true tank<br/>\nPaladins have 90% HP%AC/M./A. - 90% DPS - 120% Taunt - shared spells from Clerics, Stuns belong to Taunt, the other spells don\'t leave a Paladin at more than 15% of a Cleric, still making them a well rounded class<br/>\nShadow Knights have maybe 90% HP%AC/M./A. - 90% DPS - 120% Taunt - added utility / DPS from Necromancers, which partly also count as Taunt.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the Healer side (visionary):<br/>\nClerics have 100% heals - 100% buffs - 10% utility (rez) - 5% spell DPS - 30% melee DPS (assuming Highend Warriors getting 100 DPS)<br/>\nDruids have 60% heals - 50% buffs - 100% utility (various) - 80% spell DPS - 0% melee DPS<br/>\nShamans have 50% heals - 100% buffs - 100% utility (big factor slow and some others) - 80% spell DPS - 5% melee DPS (??)<br/>\n<br/>\nWith these skill combination, tanks are quite balanced, leaving the need for some small tweaks for Warriors though (either 5% more HP/AC/M./A. or like 10 more taunt in the end game, only taunt at about +5% in the normal 50+ game), healers are still a bit out of whack, which can be countered by higher skills of players though.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe entire balance of usefullness on raids, in groups, soloing, for casters, priests, melees and hybrids, in the 5 categories and inbetween the categories, versus the PvE and the PvP status of the game as well as versus the different opinions of the players about single aspects is ungodly hard anyways. In the end I would like to reach an agreement here about a few points:<br/>\n- All classes should have 1/15th% chance to get into a group, if not that then 33% chance to be chosen for the spot of their categorie<br/>\n- Warriors need a few little tweaks, not as strong that they exceed their 33% share of chances for the tank spot though<br/>\n- While the powerdistribution on raids is surely in favor of specialists and soloing in favor of versatility classes, it must be mostly equal in xp groups<br/>\n- This all must be done without anymore nerfs and without too much mudflation / trivialisation of content<br/>\n<br/>\nShay</t>','5d7d6023c73e49b8cb32879c5f34efe0',0,'','haomawgx',1,0,'',0,0,0,1,0,'',0),(728,202,37,51,0,'68.61.123.121',1506528365,0,1,1,1,1,'','UBAH','<r>Lead	[-]<br/>\n avatar<br/>\n<br/>\nPosts: 0<br/>\nMay 8 03 2:55 PM<br/>\nReply Quote More<br/>\nMy Recent Posts<br/>\nTAGS : None<br/>\n<br/>\n<URL url=\"http://www.amichi.us/vbb/showthr...eadid=1243\">www.amichi.us/vbb/showthr...eadid=1243</URL><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nDroooool</r>','b38c9848a7a15b278a9233033b727600',0,'','2yds2h8y',1,0,'',0,0,0,1,0,'',0),(729,195,3,52,0,'198.86.16.250',1506528376,0,1,1,1,1,'','Re: Dear developer team: One knight\'s view of Warriors.','<t>Quote:<br/>\n<br/>\nWarriors have 100% HP/AC/M./A. - 100% DPS - 100% Taunt - no other skills that turn them into a true tank<br/>\nPaladins have 90% HP%AC/M./A. - 90% DPS - 120% Taunt - shared spells from Clerics, Stuns belong to Taunt, the other spells don\'t leave a Paladin at more than 15% of a Cleric, still making them a well rounded class<br/>\nShadow Knights have maybe 90% HP%AC/M./A. - 90% DPS - 120% Taunt - added utility / DPS from Necromancers, which partly also count as Taunt.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nEffective AC/mitigation/avoidance: Wow, all three are pretty much in the same spot!<br/>\nEffective HP: wow, look!

I just feel there isnt enough of a trade off .. hybrids get the use of magic and some utility warriors dont get enough to compensate for this. <br/>\n<br/>\nPallys REALLY help out with Group heals making them really efficient on xp grinds (wave of Prexus with cleric DA skill is GREAT!) and their added aggro management saves clerics even more mana. SK\'s have incredible (probably the best) aggro management again compensating for the bit more hp the warrior has (interm of healing effectiveness). With the exsistance of KEI / Tranquility and Bard songs the Hybrid mana pool is not an issue in grinds interms of using mana for aggro.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for saying Warriors have a role in raids .. this is the part that gets me. Lets get down to the brunt of it ... 1 warrior has \'A\' role in the raid as MT .. IF on a bigger raid you MAY have 2-4 warriors as Add Tanks - Secondary Tanks. This really imho should NOT be really classified as a class BENEFIT. So really ALL the other warriors have just as much as a role on a raid as the hybrids.<br/>\n<br/>\nLets face it, Warrior taunt CAN NOT hold agro sufficiently enough with level and pure taunt skill (Yes I even have the 10% modifier helm) alone in a grind group. I\'m at level 64 atm and my agro is terrible atm due to the fact I dont have decent proc weapons (enraging blow weaps are FAR too rare).<br/>\n<br/>\nI do agree we should be given a better shot at a group LIKE clerics due to the fact of how DEPENDANT our class is on a group.

The problem is people are throwing out numbers that are A) imposible to accurately measure because of how gear and AA effects then and B) are just made up in their heads. <br/>\n<br/>\nTake a paladin and a warrior, give them both similar weapons and AA. The warrior will outdmg the paladin by a good amount. Yes you can find situations where a Paladin does more DPS, but its generally not a fair comparison. People say Paladins tank just as good as a warrior. Thats not true at all, tanks require quite a bit more healing than a warrior if they don\'t use their own spells. Paladin spells are designed to make up for those flaws. <br/>\n<br/>\nStick a lvl 65 paladin that hasn\'t gotten AA yet and only has FT1 from his solistice earring into a group with no mana regen. Watch just how useful those \'spells\' are for him. He\'ll barely keep up with mana just casting the stuns he uses for aggro. Now give him FT15 and c4... completely different ballgame. Now stick him in a group with a FT15 cleric with C4.. now his spells are useless except aggro again because the cleric has virtually endless mana... now replace the cleric with a shaman... now the paladin is useful again because his heals are needed.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe point is you can\'t judge balance by taking a freeze frame of where you character is compared to others right now. You need to take the view from 10,000 feet up and look at the big picture, which most don\'t. Paladin spells just aren\'t useful in many situations, nobody adds us to a group for dps, nobody generally adds us to a group that already has a tank, very few occassions are we added to a group for our spells because healing is generally covered by the priest. We are more or less in the same position as a warrior.. only getting groups to tank.

That being that groups are always \"maximized\". This leads the less self-confident to believe earnestly that the reason that they cannot find groups is due to not being in a \'maximized\' class. Maximized meaning that groups always consist of Best tank, Best healer, Best Slower, Best CC, and Best DPS.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe REALITY is that groups are made up from any 6 people, an can take on a whole multitude of forms. I\'ve seen rangers tanking, warriors tanking, SK\'s tanking, paladins tanking, pets tanking... hell, I\'ve seen bards tanking... IN PoP. You need not be the BEST to have a spot doing it. I\'ve been in a PoS group with Drui/Shaman/War/Pal/War/Ranger. It was an insane group, and we never slowed down the pulls. Sure, I died a couple times, even had the Pally res me back in, and STILL made out like a champ on exp.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, I would argue that because of our one dimensionality, we SHOULD be the best at it, as we serve no other purpose.

Paladins who suck at being Paladins use this as a crutch to garner support for increased power rather than learning and relishing in the powers that they already have. In other words, You shouldn\'t be as good at tanking as a warrior, you shouldn\'t be as good at healing as a cleric, and you shouldn\'t be as good at DPS as a War/Monk/Rogue/Ranger, because you have intrinsically all that they have and more.

You\'re assuming a couple of things:<br/>\n<br/>\n1. Warriors have an acceptable level of access to taunt weapons. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis is patently false, as taunt weapons are NOT a class based \"right\". Sure, I\'ve got nice weapons with EB, but I\'m not the \"average\" warrior. I see warriors all the time on the serverwide channel asking questions about weapons which I cannot believe for one second that people use at the levels in which they use them, and then I realize how lucky I am. You can NOT make an argument about inherent skills of a class with a piece of equipment, because that piece of equipment is NOT a class \"right\". My ability to hold aggro with my weapons which drop from raid level higher end mobs cannot compare with your ability to hold aggro with level 15 spells, or vendor bought spells, or even PoP level spells.<br/>\n<br/>\nFinally, a word about AE Taunt and PoP. Since you are cluless I\'ll fill you in. AE taunt can be remarkable and at the same time it can be VERY painful. The \"AE Taunt\" argument is ONLY valid if you have a single mob in an area or multiple mobs that are in the process of being mezzed. PoP has come up with creative ways to mess with warriors using AE Taunt. If you AE taunt to save someone, or to control the situation with multiple mobs around, your health starts to fall fast... this becomes a death sentence for the cleric because on your next heal, he\'s dead. I\'ve done a few boss mobs the first time where AE Taunt has actually screwed up the fight by me dying rather fast or clerics getting too much aggro on next heal. Jeplak, Lord of the Srerendi, Neffiken, Lord of the Kelek`Vor, Terris Thule, hell, even Aerin`Dar are all anti-AE taunt mobs, most of PoP with multiple adds that spawn during fight make AE taunt FAR less valid as a guaranteed aggro generation technique as it was in Luclin. <br/>\n<br/>\nQuote:<br/>\nthey want shadow knights because they can also pull more safely and can bring some minor regen, mana regen to a group or they want a paladin who can hold aggro and reduce dmg through self healing and stuns which is sort of a poor mans mana regen for the healers. I don\'t see that as unbalanced at all.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI do, because there\'s no inherent COST to having a Paladin, vs. Having a warrior. The COST to a warrior is you\'ll probably be beaten upon a few times, and you have to restrict your DPS to ensure that the warrior can get aggro.<br/>\n<br/>\nQuote:<br/>\nAlso don\'t spout out the if you don\'t agree with me you must suck at your class BS, that gets an argument nowhere fast.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nLook at what I\'m saying, those Paladins who think that they MUST be tanking to have value, or who let others die while they\'re engaged in melee suck at being paladins.

I\'m also part of a fairly guild, which though I love them with all my heart, is just big enough to fight in kael, which is no help, considering I\'m KOS everywhere in Velious (originally ally to giants, but am trying to switch to dragons. Dwarves are stains on my boots =)<br/>\n<br/>\nI understand that as I may get into the higher levels of the games, things may change and warriors become compairable to Hybrids, but at this level, and these circumstances, I often question why I even play my warrior anymore (aside from the guild. I LOVE my guild!)<br/>\n<br/>\nHeck, I\'ve even began a Shadowknight. It took hell to get him twinked (not by your standards of twink, but what I could do), but he\'s 28 and soloing yellows and even a red now and then. All just from his fear and darkness spells.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyways, I\'ve ranted enough. I feel that equipment changes to improve Warriors is a faulty idea that will only support those who can actually afford it. I feel that warriors need to be tweaked so that their mid-game capabilities are higher, which in itself might lead Warriors to have a slightly higher end-game capability, bringing them at least up to par.<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you for hearing the ramblings of a lizard.<br/>\n<br/>\nLegionnaire Gannor P\'Artak<br/>\n&lt;Sirens of the Storm&gt;<br/>\n48 Iksar Warrior<br/>\nDrinal Server<br/>\n<br/>\nPS - I\'ve admired this Forum since Pre-Velious, but as quietly as possable.

As far as acecess to taunt weapons there are other ways to deal with aggro.

DPS: Your theory holds true ONLY IF warriors and paladins are both equipping similar 2hs weapons, and are BOTH hitting from the rear... then and ONLY then do warriors outdamage knights. But... you\'ve so many times stressed that warriors should be wielding EB weapons that actually lower our DPS by a large margin, and don\'t take into account the MULTITUDES of pally/SK weapons that are out there compared to war usable (and war only is a myth). The regular paladin is going to be doing similar DPS as the regular Warrior in the real world. I\'d accept your premise of 80% if there were equivalent distribution/drops on gear, but as it is now, there isn\'t, a fact that simply CANNOT be overlooked.<br/>\n<br/>\n2. Tanking: You do NOT take 20% more melee damage than warriors, that statement is fallacious and ignorant. you take (and trust me, I\'ve run the numbers on this one) 1.5% less melee damage than warriors, this is based on avoidance skill differences, the ONLY place where Paladins are at a disadvantage. Warriors wouldn\'t have ANY complaints if you were taking 20% more damage than us.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut... don\'t believe me? Fine, don\'t.... Listen to how a Paladin on your OWN boards reacted to your claims...<br/>\n<br/>\nQuote:<br/>\nWell Fraust, all I can tell ya is that if I go LFG in Valor on one of those rare occasions that I don\'t have a guild group and there is a warrior of the same level looking for a group 99 times out of 100 I\'ll get a group before he does. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs for SK\'s pulling, anyone with half a brain can get doubles in Valor at any camp. Root one on the way in, have the enchanter mez it where rooted, then immediately slow the other one. Only paladins and SK\'s can guarantee an enchanter that they won\'t get beat down by an immediate slow if its resisted every single pull. No other class in the game can stop a valor/hoh/cod mob from hitting for 4 seconds if it looks like the CH is going to be late or to simply cut down on its damage. Our DPS with high end 2h is comparable to high aggro 1hs on a warrior, within 5% (much to their dismay). A paladin with a windblade will outdamage a warrior with primal/priceless.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe bottom line is this, if you think your class sucks, you\'re going to play it like it sucks. You\'re going to exude suckiness. If you look at what your class CAN do instead of what it can\'t, you\'re going to impress people and be in high demand.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPretty much wraps up YOUR argument in a nutshell....<br/>\n<br/>\nFinally... this misnomer about aggro control being a group\'s responsibility...<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is true UNLESS a Paladin is tanking, then there\'s no need to hold back. A Paladin actually INCREASES a group\'s DPS by letting them go hog wild vs. warriors, so don\'t give me this \"Just jump through 145 hoops and it\'s easy\" line. <br/>\n<br/>\nWarriors are STILL at a disadvantage to Paladins in a WARRIOR\'s bread and butter job, which is melee damage absorption. As I previously said, taunt issues are fine as long as my damage absorption advantage justifies it. Currently in non-disc mode it doesn\'t... at all. When both classes can acheive the AC cap easy, and the HP pool difference is about 8-12% raw hp, with your extra HP tucked away in your manabar and LoH buttons, it\'s not 20% difference, the ONLY difference is about 1.5% based on avoidance skill differences.</t>','73fc61c6d660f949b9c4dfa3735f7cef',0,'','kklf7ed9',1,0,'',0,0,0,1,0,'',0),(767,195,3,52,0,'198.86.16.250',1506528905,0,1,1,1,1,'','Re: Dear developer team: One knight\'s view of Warriors.','<t>I disagree with that person pretty strongly, he claims that paladins are the best tank hands down in PoP. I think all tanks are pretty balanced. If you want I can quote seventhswords posts about how we are a terrible class, but I don\'t believe what he says either. Paladins are a balanced class with some minor issues just like every class has minor issues. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as the 1.5% avoidance, prove it. First off you need to add in the extra hps, since heals are done with CH its part of the equation. THen you have to add in your disciplines because they do matter and they do make you a lot better. Then add in percantage based AA that widen the margin. All said and done you take a warrior and paladin in similar gear, exp with them for an entire night and look at how much less dmg the warrior takes it is significant amount, not 1.5%. Paladins offest this by using spells such as self heals and stuns. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs for DPS, we parse our raids quite a bit, we almost always see a 15-20% DPS advantage on warriors over knights... that is not counting procs which shortens that gap somewhat. Shadow Knights offset this by using spells to add to DPS.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere are some examples that are pretty high quality. The rogues had bards in their groups so their dps is inflated a bit. These were mobs where our paladins were not needed for healing. All players using ssra quality weapons.

If you really want to see a good illustration of the class balance issues, ignore for a moment the AA abilities, and the gear that the majority of us warriors who are more casual gamers will never see. Take a look at the mid level game, where, in similar gear, hybrids are just plain better in most situations, and certainly in xp groups. Not to mention soloing, which is pretty much not an option past 40 for warriors because of the risk and the downtime. Currently I\'m 51st level, so I havent really seen the high end game yet, but I can say with certainty that from about 30 to 51, hybrids, particularly pallys and sk\'s outshine the warrior in most situations. And even at that level, what they lack in pure tanking ability they more than make up for with better ability to gain/keep aggro, better utility, and the ability to solo something that actually gives them xps. <br/>\nAgain, I dont have any AA or disciplines yet, but from my perspective, in the levels I\'ve seen so far, pally\'s and sk\'s are basically warriors with spells.

As I posted in PoN, this is almost exactly the spread I would have expected assuming you keep in mind the rogues had more haste than others so their dps is pumped up a bit high.<br/>\nFraustkilicus, Halfling Paladin</t>','77e099ea35efbc4da0379f3c99941234',0,'','3bgbh9wu',1,0,'',0,0,0,1,0,'',0),(774,204,37,51,0,'68.61.123.121',1506529222,0,1,1,1,1,'','Re: Korby Ubertank\'s Guide to the Warrior Epic','<t>Re: Korby Ubertank\'s Guide to the Warrior Epic	  #9	[-]<br/>\n avatar<br/>\n<br/>\nPosts: 0<br/>\nFeb 28 03 12:02 AM<br/>\nReply Quote More<br/>\nMy Recent Posts<br/>\nVery good walkthru.

Warriors.','<t>I wonder why so many people think that their DPS role and their tanking role should stack at 100%...<br/>\n<br/>\nIt doesn\'t for Paladins, nor for Shadow Knights and shouldn\'t for Warriors as well - one tanks... one focusses on getting/holding agro... one gives up DPS for that.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is the same for all classes with their various roles:<br/>\na Cleric that focusses on healing doesn\'t add DPS by nuking or meleeing, a Druid nuking doesn\'t heal as much, a Shaman buffing and slowing doesn\'t heal or dot a lot neither. If you get that role on a raid or in a group and accept it, live with doing the other task to a lesser degree.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, disciplines are a part of the Warrior class, but I really rarely see Warriors use them in xp groups. But they would have to be included whenever fighting and able because they belong into the equitation, be it a defensive disc of any kind if the Warrior is tanking or an offensive one if he is not, but adding DPS. Use those discs as often as possible in fights and reparse the numbers, I bet, the result will look different over time (of course have also the Knights use theirs). One cannot include Knight spells but not disciplines.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe word \"overpowered\" fell in this discussion already for Paladins. That is far from being true!! A Paladin never was nor is the go-or-stay for a raid, the Paladin never was nor is the best at the roles he has, never has been such a powerfull class to be able to solo amongst the most efficient while adding a lot to raids. Shamans add tons to raids while being powerfull soloers AND balanced in xp groups, Monks add tons to raids, were powerfull soloers and still are balanced in groups, bards are very powerfull in raids, groups and solo play as well, just people don\'t realize their power too often. Soloing dragons, nonstop xp-farming entire camps in pickupgroup zones, getting tank spots as DPS class, killing over 4 mobs on one kite - all while being great additions, searched for additions to any group and raid, that one could call overpowered. Classes like that have been nerfed (see: monk - not judging if it was rightfully or not, I hate nerfs in general) or not been touched because the game was designed with them in mind. The game was designed with also Warriors as tanks, not with Knights tanking, Knight just have been dragged up to not be too unefficient as a tank - which is the main specialisation of Knights as for Warriors.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor groups Paladins are finally balanced, they can take the tank spot, as can the Warrior, as can the Shadow Knight. That means we actually GET groups, with an equal chance as the other two tanks. That is balance, and guess what: The formerly overbalanced (not overpowered) class loses a bit of ground if a \"^v\" becomes a \"--\".<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, Warriors need a few tweaks and something to add if they are not MT, a role on raids if they are not MTs. Personally I would see the need for some \"lesser EB-weapons\" in the pre-highest-end game and an improvement of their role on raids, let it be an AA skill for between 59 and 65 that allows them to improve 5% to 10% on DPS and Avoid/Mitig against mobs that are 5 to 10 levels higher than them.<br/>\nThe xp group balance would stay, the agro problem of the pre-mostuber Warriors would be reduced (to a degree that Hybrids still get/hold agro better as they are supposed to please) and their raid role would be strengthend.<br/>\n<br/>\nImproving the sheer tanking of Warriors as it is now AND getting problemless taunt into the game at some point would clearly overbalance the class again, make them a too appealing choice to take for groups over Knights.<br/>\n<br/>\nShay</t>','658518021f6a7eee159cb78eaf81f145',0,'','uohe0xr0',1,0,'',0,0,0,1,0,'',0),(793,195,3,52,0,'198.86.16.250',1506529616,0,1,1,1,1,'','Re: Dear developer team: One knight\'s view of Warriors.','<t>Quote:<br/>\nUse those discs as often as possible in fights and reparse the numbers, I bet, the result will look different over time (of course have also the Knights use theirs).

Usually there are too many x factors that allow for safe use of aggressive/fellstrike/mightystrike. Conversely, most knight DPS spells refresh fairly quickly.

Warriors are specific melee, we do nothing else. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis is ALL about balance. Paladins currently are NOT balanced, they are overpowered. Let me restate that so that there is no misunderstanding of my position. In experience groups, Paladins are overpowered. A class that can have reliable 100% aggro, must, I repeat MUST have a drawback in their ability to take a hit. Paladins do not have any drawbacks in their ability to take a hit, because of this they are indded, in experience groups the best tank bar none. <br/>\n<br/>\nHit point pool does NOT equal mitigation when CH exists.<br/>\n<br/>\nPaladins hide their hitpoint pool into their mana bar and LoH buttons, and thus total shown hitpoints are a misleading number.<br/>\n<br/>\nIncreased heal aggro hurts warriors, and helps Paladins. While it is true that taunt works better than before, the new healing aggro forces this to be necessary. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis is what it all boils down to.....<br/>\n<br/>\nIf a cleric is afraid to heal a warrior, and not the Paladin, then he DAMN well better not have to do it as often, otherwise the Paladin is overpowered.<br/>\n<br/>\nFinally, the equation of disciplines to spells is wrong. They are nowhere near the same or even close. If casting a spell disallowed the use of all other spells for 10 minutes in some cases, almost an hour in others, you\'d have a leg to stand on, but they don\'t. I have several abilities in disciplines I\'d LOVE to use but cannot because I have to save them \"just in case\". Fellstrike for instance, 15 seconds of burst damage will not let me use evasive for almost an hour. In other words, I can\'t use it if I expect to tank in the next hour. Furious, 15 seconds of automatically riposting all melee attacks... the same thing. Why would I realistically want to use this unless it\'s a special need thing? If so, I\'m crippled from any serious tanking (my alleged specialty) for an hour. You have a DA spell on an 18 minute refresh, my \"Immune to all melee damage\" discipline (not even blocking spell damage, aka, not DA) has a 59 minute refresh, in which I cannot use any other discipline. So, your 18 seconds of total invulnerability to all things which refrehes in 18 minutes vs. my eight seconds of being immune to melee damage only whcih not only refreshes in 59 minutes, but \"greys out\" all of my other disciplines for 59 minutes. Even that worthless pile of crap, Mightystrike (all hits landed are critical or crippling for 10 seconds) has a reuse time at level 65 of 54 minutes, disabling all other disciplines. In other words... the wise warrior does not use his disciplines until necessary, and even then only does he use them judiciously. They are NOT a \"point of balance\" until we\'re on raids, and it is on raids where warriors are actually where they\'re supposed to be... unless of course, they\'ve used a discipline<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, Tanking and DPS are things that warriors are real sensitive about because it\'s ALL we have, we\'ve got no other dimensions like you, the Paladin, and feel strongly that we exchanged that for increased power in our more limited dimensions.

Its obviously a hard thing to prove because it requires extensive testing with very similarly geared characters to prove and then it only proves the balance at that one split second in a persons character develpment.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy personal feeling is Paladins are one of the weaker classes at lvl 65 in lower end gear with low AA totals and one of the stronger classes at lvl 65 in high end gear with high AA totals. At no point are they overpowered or actually underpowered though. Before I started getting better gear and some AA I wasn\'t useless, just not as useful as most. My friend who has top end gear and 260ish AA is not overpowered he\'s just more powerful than most classes at that point, its not by that much though.<br/>\nFraustkilicus, Halfling Paladin</t>','59074f0469cd01c87076b15a5cead026',0,'','1n8jjx0t',1,0,'',0,0,0,1,0,'',0),(797,195,3,52,0,'198.86.16.250',1506529780,0,1,1,1,1,'','Re: Dear developer team: One knight\'s view of Warriors.','<t>Quote:<br/>\nMy friend who has top end gear and 260ish AA is not overpowered he\'s just more powerful than most classes at that point,<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI thought that given equal aa/levels/gear all classes were supposed to be as powerful as each other?<br/>\n<br/>\nThen again I could see where you came up with this, it being a perspective thing.

Warriors cannot. <br/>\n<br/>\nI really don\'t know much about SK\'s, I know a bit more about paladins in relation to groups so I\'ll speak just about them. Granted, paladin healing isn\'t the greatest healing ability in the world. They can\'t slow or mez. However, the fact remains, they can do quite an effective job of backup healing, and they can accomplish some very awesome crowd-control. Personally, my ideal group in say PoV would feature a paladin/shaman combination for CC/slow/heal rather than warrior/cleric/chanter simply because it opens up another spot for DPS or other things.

HOwever, paladins can also fill a spot as backup healer, or as ghetto CC if people are willing to be creative (and people are, I\'ve been in VERY creative groups before). Sk\'s can also FD pull, keep themselves relatively healed with taps, and can Solo. Wariors can do none of these things. So, how exactly is it \"balanced\" when hybrids have the same chance to fill a tanking role as warriors, while being able to fill roles in a group that warriors cannot?<br/>\n<br/>\nWilhelmm D\'averam<br/>\nWarlord of the Apocalypse<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWilhelmm\'s Profile</t>','0ab7b57b7495903dd7836d9e5062b617',0,'','279zj9xb',1,0,'',0,0,0,1,0,'',0),(799,195,3,52,0,'198.86.16.250',1506529808,0,1,1,1,1,'','Re: Dear developer team: One knight\'s view of Warriors.','<t>Quote:<br/>\n- Paladins and SK\'s can get into groups for purposes outside of tanking.

I very much understand that paladins also abide by the laws of mana and all that; but that doesn\'t discount their versatility.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nKnights can get onto raids for purposes outside of tanking, but not groups, Paladins aren\'t invited for their BMB, HWoP, LoH, CC (each: \"and upgrades\") combinations. Shadow Knight may be invited as pullers if the tank slot is taken, but surely not for their HP/Mana regen, group taps, HT and whatever - grab a BL and you have better anyways - and more DPS.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, and if you prefer a Shm/Pal combo over a Cle/War/Enc combo, you will have a group that consists because the players like to smoke a lot, have to clean up or anything. The Paladin needs to taunt a lot with Stuns to not have the mob attack the Shaman on every slow (Stuns cost mana), and heals cost mana too, so basically after each 3rd fight latest, you will see the Paladin sit down to med for 5 minutes.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI say it again, fully knowing that many don\'t disagree with me there, but no one really commented it, so...<br/>\n<br/>\nKnights are chosen for tanking, as are Warriors, not for DPS, not for any spells or combination of spells (SKs maybe sometimes for pulling, but I honestly see them do that on raids more than in groups). That task must be balanced in a way that all three classes can do the job without one being so strong that, if others do what they do to not get agro anyways, have such a huge advantage that the other two classes are only better-than-logging-options.<br/>\nThis being said, I think, the tanking skills of all three classes should be untouched for the normal xp group areas, as well as for lesser raids (lesser compared to what your guild can achieve).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe most central statement in this entire thread about Warriors was - freely quoted: \"Knights bring... to a raid, what do Warriors bring?\"<br/>\n<br/>\nWarriors need an enhancement to have them the only viable raid tank (except on those \"lesser raids\"), they need something that gives them a clear advantage to tank bossmobs that are the current challenge for their guilds, and they need something that allows them to add something besides the 100% mark of DPS when they have no designated tank role. For that reason I suggested the \"Mitigation / Avoidance / DPS increase against NPC of some levels above PC\" AA skill which no one has commented yet, hell, even give them a \"innate 3 second duration Enrage addition to their Frenzy\" AA which would grant them some invulnerability, i.e. higher survivelability (sp?) as tanks, I am all open to benefiting changes to that class. BUT only as long as they don\'t put me back into a pre-Sol / pre-meleepatch position.<br/>\nThe issues of the pre uber Warriors that have no access to EB weapons are taunting, taunting, taunting and taunting only. IF YOU are in a guild that can outfit them, you shouldn\'t rather forget about your younger, less uber fellows. Those still have big advantages in HP/AC/DPS to comparable Knights, they just cannot hold agro against all the other 14 classes whose skills have been tuned up along with the agro those skills produces.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo be honest, I so no reason, why a Druid should be LFG longer than a Cleric for xp groups, yes, the Druid is better at soloing, but: No Cleric, no raid! Druids bring something to a raid, yes, but they are still not required.<br/>\nThe same applies to Warriors as core class and Knights in the end game, the same applies in most cases to Enchanters as core class and Bards/Necromancers. Many players of local uber- and hightier-guilds told me so, and there are like 3 topend of them and many more that do stuff that is challenging to their guilds.<br/>\n<br/>\nShay</t>','1eaae0b8ef1d57f99f92a51aae2914ad',0,'','308tcp3y',1,0,'',0,0,0,1,0,'',0),(800,195,3,52,0,'198.86.16.250',1506529820,0,1,1,1,1,'','Re: Dear developer team: One knight\'s view of Warriors.','<t>I\'m a bit of an outsider looking in, my main is a druid.

Since Phase 3 beta (Novemeber of 98 or was it even 99?! Damn too long!) and I too have seen so many classes get balanced / over balanced .. or over \'nerfed\'.<br/>\n<br/>\nUpcoming is just my opinion only so please no one take offense to this....<br/>\n<br/>\nIn my view.. Shamans are now far more vital and useful than clerics in PoV/PoS due to Slows / Kraggs / Buffs in comparison to the only real thing clerics offer and that being CH. Well actually perhaps the Remedy/Light line of heals. I dont count rez\'s cuz I dont count on dieing especially in a good group. <br/>\n<br/>\nBards are now taking preference over Enchanters due to the fact a group can just ask a friendly chanter for KEI then get a bard to further the efficiency of the group grind, by stacking the bard song with that chanter KEI. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe\'re now also seeing Hybrids (SK/Pal) taking preference over warriors in groups due to their versatility. SK more for the controlled agro which saves mana for the main healer in a grind, and Pal\'s not only for their added agro but their spot heals and their quick on the go group heals to compliment cleric DA (AA Skill).<br/>\n<br/>\nIts clear to me VI wanted to do something about the Trinity Classes but this is alittle excessive imho. Its seems now that being Versatile is far more beneficial to groups as it is to specialize (well for PoS-PoV grinds for the most part). Personally I dont think its really quite fair, considering by specializing warriors and clerics, in particular, are argueably the most boring classes in game to level. In specializing they had the benefit of being prefered generally for grouping but taking that away from them really doesnt leave much considering the lack of versatility.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll I ask of VI is as EQDuffy mentioned, give us a Taunt (CLASS SKILL not some cheap fix item proc) that WORKS. Heck I\'d live with the fact the only difference between a warrior tanking and a hybrid tanking is 1.5% damage, (mentioned above) not due to mitigation but the slight differential in damage avoidance.

OF COURSE the mob jumps on the shaman at every slow ! But honestly, where is the problem ? Me, as a warrior, wihtout your wonderful stuns that cost SOOOO much mana, i can outtant the mob after 1 or maybe 2 pressions on my lame taunt button. I guess a paladin can do exactly the same if by the greatest of unfortunes he runs oom. The shaman can also root the mob and step back. Or just tank for some time, slowed mobs are pansies (i am not talking here about big mofo mobs that can kill a shaman in 2 hits, you usually dont fight those in exp groups). The point of the question is not here anyway. The point is exactly in this :<br/>\n<br/>\n1. Paladins and SKs tank as good as warriors, maybe just a bit not so good, sometimes better with good gear.<br/>\n<br/>\n2. Paladins and SKs DPS match approximatively Warrior\'s DPS.<br/>\n<br/>\n3. Paladins and SKs taunt alot better with their spells, keep the mob on them is a joke for those classes. Warrior\'s taunt, even if the skill cap is higher, is much more relaying on DPS and eventual procs. 90% of the warriors wont ever see a EB weapon. 100% of Paladins and SKs can buy their basic spells.<br/>\n<br/>\n4. Paladins and SKs get many useful spells that grant them some solo abilities, increase their survavibility in dangerous areas and brings something more to groups than just pure tanking. Warriors dont get anything of this.<br/>\n<br/>\n5. Warriors get some useful disciplines, which are defensive / evasive, furious / fortitude and maybe aggressive. I dont speak about the other lame ones. The only problem is that those discs are mainly designed for raid situations or desperate situations, so you cannot afford to use them whenever you want to, because of the timer. Paladins and SKs dont get those useful disciplines.<br/>\n<br/>\nThose points are FACTS, there is no need to discuss it, you only can take it like it is. The problem resulting from those 5 points it that you get 2 supposed hybrids that tank just aswell as a warrior, dish as much of damage out, BUT bring extra bonusses to the group, can farm stuff without too much problems, can eventually solo something that gives them exp and are funnier to play because of this.<br/>\n<br/>\nActually, for me the problem is that i see group leaders using hybrids as MTs in exp groups because they hold aggro better and bring some versatility, and can tank perfectly, when before the SoL patches warriors had clearly that role by default.<br/>\n<br/>\nBUT i still cannot solo for experience efficiently, and i still cannot farm lvl 30 mobs without a Fungi. If you are just a bit fair, it becomes clear that something has to be fixed for warrior\'s class, because it just becomes completely screwed up. At least, before hybrid competition for spots in exp groups you had good chances to find one, because warriors were NEEDED, like clerics. Now, warriors are not NEEDED anymore. Tanks are still needed of course, but an hybrid can play this role without ANY real drawback, when warrior\'s drawback in this role is MUCH less efficient taunt and NOTHING else to bring to the group than pure tanking.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is some different ways to balance the new class issue. You can leave everything like it is but increase warrior\'s base HP, or natural defense capacities, or even increase it\'s DPS. It is also possible to make warrior\'s disciplines \"exp group usables\", IE divide the timers by 2 or 3 for the longest ones, or just put each discipline on a different independant timer. It is also possible to increase the efficiency of warrior\'s taunt, but i think it still would be a too small upgrade. Like Remorse said, you cant take away all the benefits of being specialized from specialized classes and give a @#%$ nothing in return (well, clerics at least got some real DPS in return... what the @#%$ did get warriors so far ?), that\'s completely unfair and frustrating. By the way, i totally disagree with that :<br/>\n<br/>\nQuote:<br/>\nTo be honest, I so no reason, why a Druid should be LFG longer than a Cleric for xp groups, yes, the Druid is better at soloing, but: No Cleric, no raid!<br/>\nAnd how the @#%$ would your Cleric have the level to attend raids, if his potential group spots as specialist of healing become canibalized by \"quadding druids suddently wanting dungeon phat lewt\" ??? Who would bother to play a Cleric if he can play a druid, have a blast at solo, get paid for TPs, and still have the same chances to find a group like everyone else ?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy the hell if so to not make all the classes completely equal, so everyone would get the same chances to get into a group and have the same solo abilities huh ? Imagine, for example, everyone would be able to mez like an enchanter, heal like a cleric, tank like a warrior and nuke like a wizard, and to summon a lvl 60 epic mage pet huh ? Bah, it is an idea ! Eveyrone would be happy this way no ? You just would have to pick a look and a race for your character (without any racial drawbacks of course, or people would still not be happy to be wood elves when there are ogres around). At least, if you still cannot find a group, you would know that it is because you are just too lame, not as a class but as the person sitting behind the comp.<br/>\n<br/>\nViladdar Orcslayer - Teir\'Dal Myrmidon<br/>\n<br/>\nKINESIS</t>','ba50af3e4d28bf735a519decb331c212',0,'','ts0urs4r',1,0,'',0,0,0,1,0,'',0),(803,204,37,51,0,'68.61.123.121',1506529943,0,1,1,1,1,'','Re: Korby Ubertank\'s Guide to the Warrior Epic','<t>thank you korby	  #18	[-]<br/>\n avatar<br/>\n<br/>\nPosts: 0<br/>\nApr 5 03 1:27 AM<br/>\nReply Quote More<br/>\nMy Recent Posts<br/>\nJust completed my epic tonight and wanted to say thanks Korby.

Sorry, you can\'t be more wrong, they are chosen because they are tanks, and they can taunt and hold the agro.<br/>\nPersonally I\'ve been only chosen over Warriors because people knew my skills because they had grouped with me already. For that reason I\'ve been choosen over 65 Paladins when I was 62 as well, so, it is skill and reputation also.<br/>\n<br/>\nQuote:<br/>\n1. Paladins and SKs tank as good as warriors, maybe just a bit not so good, sometimes better with good gear<br/>\n<br/>\n4. Paladins and SKs get many useful spells that grant them some solo abilities, increase their survavibility in dangerous areas and brings something more to groups than just pure tanking. Warriors dont get anything of this.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n1.) Soloing is dead with PoP, you either get no xp or you die trying a mob that would give xp. Well, a Warrior needs a Fungi for soloing? Aaaaw how sad, I have seen a Rogue soloing in FG prePoP with a Fungi and Rogue-Buffs only, and quiet efficiently at that. Maybe you should take some friends to Shrooms King some day to farm the tunic...<br/>\n<br/>\n4.) That\'s why Warriors tank better and have such usefull discs. PoP dangerous zones... Only SoW/E, Horse, similar really helps, since until you get a agroing mob rooted, you\'ll be half dead.<br/>\n<br/>\nQuote:<br/>\nBUT i still cannot solo for experience efficiently, and i still cannot farm lvl 30 mobs without a Fungi.<br/>\n<br/>\nMobs in FG aren\'t 30, but rather 45, I\'ve seen a Rogue do it, so could you.<br/>\n<br/>\nQuote:<br/>\nAnd how the @#%$ would your Cleric have the level to attend raids, if his potential group spots as specialist of healing become canibalized by \"quadding druids suddently wanting dungeon phat lewt\" ???

Because YOU love solo so much doesn\'t mean all people do, I honestly pity all the Druids in PoP that aren\'t being chosen as DPS dealers, as Healers neither, and their Snare, Sow, Evac is too few in the eyes of a group to take them (this is also directed to the one that said that the few versatility spells of knights would get them into groups).<br/>\n<br/>\nYou know the difference between specialists and versatility classes? Specialists are the best at something, be it healing, tanking or whatever, versatile classes MUST have a skill of the specialists to about 80% degree so that they are chosen into groups for something, SoW, Levi, Circle of Knowledge, group life tap, BMB aren\'t what those classes are chosen for, cannot repeat that often enough.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe tank world IS balanced now (aside from some needed tweaks for taunting and maybe raid tanking for Warriors), the healer world not yet, but that isn\'t topic here...<br/>\n<br/>\nShay</t>','a363f66a82d80631c3f8ec1700743d94',0,'','iqtcbl46',1,0,'',0,0,0,1,0,'',0),(811,195,3,52,0,'198.86.16.250',1506530069,0,1,1,1,1,'','Re: Dear developer team: One knight\'s view of Warriors.','<t>In fact the point where i disagree with you Shay is basically this one :<br/>\nQuote:<br/>\nversatile classes MUST have a skill of the specialists to about 80% degree<br/>\n<br/>\nI think 80% is too much. 70% would be more acceptable. I understand that you are speaking about GROUP play, but dont forget that there are other areas in the game : PvP, Stuff camping (for stuff or money), Solo play (for exp), Raid. Warriors had an advantage for group play, but now this advantage have been clearly reduced if not completely removed. Warrior\'s weaknesses have not been fixed in PvP / Stuff camping / Solo areas as compensation, and his Raid skills have not been improved. So, something must be done at least in one of the 4 remaining areas besides group play, if everyone is satisfied with group play balancing as it is now (i\'m not but well). By the way, imo raid abilities of warriors are fine and dont NEED upgrades (even if they would be welcomed, its always cool to get upgrades), unless VI turns completely insane and decides to give furious and defensive to hybrids.<br/>\n<br/>\nAbout the soloing part, i just hate it, but i think it might be sometimes a nice advantage to be able to solo something (dont put the lame \"solo with appropriate gear ie ToD + Fungi\" thing on the table, i\'m speaking about innate class abilities). Hell, playing a Necro, soloing hill giants \"fingers in da noose\" at lvl 30 and grabbing massive plat of them (for the level of course) can be really fun. You have to pay for this when you suddently realize at 51 that as a necro, you are one of the most useless classes for raids, and not needed at all in exp grinds (i say needed, not \"not accepted\").<br/>\n<br/>\nDruids are an another thing, people always scream that druids are useless in groups and raids, but imo it is totally false. Druids got many useful things that make them welcome to both raids and exp grinds - evac, snare, sow, track, good healing abilities, buffs and nukes. The total of all those cool tricks is their strength and their main purpose, they should never compete with clerics, because clerics are not \"versatility specialists\" but \"healing specialists\", what has never made the main part of being a druid. Once again, if you talk ONLY about PoP issues and poor druids not getting invites in PoP, remember that there are many other places in Norrath besides PoP. Of course, we wont speak here about reputation / friends thing, for my part, my friends would invite me in their group even if i were naked and without weapons. Now, if you think that druids have to be fixed for the 60-65 part of the game (ie PoP), i\'d say that i have no opinion.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, if the discussion is focused exclusively on PoP and lvl 60 to 65 part of the game, you might be right aswell, I just dont know enough of it to speak about with some sense. I\'m about the game from lvl 1 to 60 in all its sectors, and how sucky it is to be a warrior when hybrids begin to fill warrior\'s spots in exp groups. For my part, the only real and valuable upgrade for warriors (well it\'s for everybody) i\'ve seen since i play EQ is Plane of Knowledge and all those wonderful little books that you can click on to get a free TP to wherever you want to go. Dont know how much plat i gave away to dr00ds and wizards, but i\'d better dont count it.<br/>\n<br/>\nViladdar Orcslayer - Teir\'Dal Myrmidon<br/>\n<br/>\nKINESIS</t>','5a4a7c4ea0dfcf7296bf1aab0908a600',0,'','1wo7wt6y',1,0,'',0,0,0,1,0,'',0),(812,195,3,52,0,'198.86.16.250',1506530082,0,1,1,1,1,'','Re: Dear developer team: One knight\'s view of Warriors.','<t>\"Stuns, root, healing = utility. Stuns, root, healing = lots of aggro control on the paladins part.<br/>\nNo trade off there.\"<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe point is you are saying you can\'t count EB weapons into warrior aggro because most lack that level of gear. Well most Paladins lack FT gear that aren\'t in the type of guild that can acquire EB weapons. So unless you have a mana regen class in group Paladins can hold aggro and thats it. When I 2 box with my shaman with FT3 and no other mana regen I can stun a few times to take aggro and thats it. If I heal my mana level goes down. If I have to root it goes down. After a few fights it would go down enough I\'d have to meditate. So basically without an enchanter/bard in group I lose most of the utility you speak of. <br/>\n<br/>\nNow lets look at the high end game. The warriors DO have EB weapons and hold aggro adequately. So we lose a little bit in the aggro comparison department as a Paladin. The clerics DO have lots of FT, so suddenly they don\'t really need us to heal in an exp grind. That leaves paladins as a lower DPS, lower quality tank with stuns and slightly better aggro, I don\'t see that as overpowered.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur guild generally either picks a warrior first as MT in a group or will take any of the classes equally, depending on the players in group. I have yet to see a single person turn down a warrior for a group in preference to any of our Paladins though.<br/>\nFraustkilicus, Halfling Paladin</t>','2bb4469efc0d163846340d8f9e54700f',0,'','1mi10fjx',1,0,'',0,0,0,1,0,'',0),(813,195,3,52,0,'198.86.16.250',1506530101,0,1,1,1,1,'','Re: Dear developer team: One knight\'s view of Warriors.','<t>Fraus,<br/>\n<br/>\nThe point isn\'t that anyone gets \"turned down for someone else\", I simply don\'t see it happenning. I\'ve already said, most groups at ANY end of the game don\'t ditz around with Maximizing, that\'s a myth. They need a tank, a slower, a healer, and some blanks to fill in. MOST groups aren\'t sitting around with a spreadsheet going \"no, this class is x% less efficient than another class, therefore we\'ll wait till that class is LFG\", they take whoever\'s available.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat irks me to no end though is more mechanical. Any assertion that defensively warriors have an edge beyond the avoidance skill differences over anyone else is patently false. This isn\'t enough of a difference to justify their \"specialization\" or \"lack\" in all other areas. Mitigation does NOT equal hitpoints. Let me state that again so that you\'ll not be mistaken, total hitpoints are NOT, in a game where complete heal exists and at least 3 classes can exceed the maximum number of hitpoints healed, part of any mitigation factor. Invoking hitpoints is a straw man. Mitigation is simple. How hard does a monster hit when he lands a blow? Then avoidance is factored in \"how often does he land a blow?\". <br/>\n<br/>\nAs we are quite aware, or at least should be, warriors do NOT have an inherent AC advantage past HoT armor. This *may* change in the Elemental planes, but as it stands now, it\'s true. The best equipment available to warriors in terms of AC is also available to Paladins and SK\'s at least. Defense skill is also identical. Therefore, the ONLY realistic difference in potential for tanking is avoidance skill differences. Based on numerous tets which I ran and publicly posted, this turns out to be approximately 1.5% less damage taken over the course of a fight. This is also potentially compenstated for with mobs now being stunnable (thereby stopping them from landing melee attacks for a period of time). I can\'t say one way or another, as I don\'t have access to a 65 Paladin, but I\'ll ask for some logs from the same zones and run them. The ONLY real valid point that I\'ve seen is in disciplines. I agree that when disciplines are used, it does make the warrior perform better in almost every circumstance, but there\'s a penalty to this in that they exist for short times and have fairly long refresh times. How this fits into balance, I don\'t know, but I personally rarely use disciplines in experience groups unless there\'s an \"oh crap\" situation. <br/>\n<br/>\nNow, warriors have been complaining about aggro difficulties (particularly healing aggro) since the release of PoP, and now VI has stated that a problem DOES exist and it is in the process of being fixed. Your assertion that \"taunt works fine\" has been well, nullified. Those fighting at level 65 don\'t necessarily all have EB weapons, and to think that they do because of your limited experience with your own guild is incorrect. I have one EB weapon, but not all warriors in my guild do. You play on a server that is a PvP server, and spawn competitions are not anywhere near equal between yours and blue servers, and limited spawns per population of classes between servers nullifies balance via itemization.</t>','6c3a33522763f483612609ae70ff8abb',0,'','z21lhll0',1,0,'',0,0,0,1,0,'',0),(814,195,3,52,0,'198.86.16.250',1506530113,0,1,1,1,1,'','Re: Dear developer team: One knight\'s view of Warriors.','<t>Quote:<br/>\n- The general Kick skill should have added a Agro increasing component which equals the Paladin spell: Stun.

I don\'t know about SK\'s because they\'re not as loud as Paladins, but I know this. True \"balance\" doesn\'t negate specialization, nor does it preclue one group from being \"the best\". From a warrior\'s perspective, tanking is anything BUT balanced between the 3 plate classes.

It is just that I do not want to see the group play touched which IS balanced - as every group only takes one tank, they rather shouldn\'t be better of / more efficient with a Warrior than with Knights (in an average groupsetup), else Knights are left in the dust. To help you, I suggested here and /feedbacked, that...<br/>\n... Warriors need a slight taunt improvement in the 50 to 55+ area, so the entire group can have more fun<br/>\n... Warriors need a better raid role when not MTing (AA skill to burst group\'s atk value / DPS for 1 min?)<br/>\n... Clear advantages over Knights when tanking on raids<br/>\n<br/>\nI ask all of you that are angry about your current state to stay reasonable about what you ask for, and to also watch the other side of the coin. Knights already had a long time with severe difficulties to get groups, and the chances to get one were below 33% as it is now (three tankclasses, each 33% chance sounds fair to me at least as the 2 casters among them aren\'t invited for their spells /shrug).<br/>\n<br/>\nEnchanters and Clerics as specialists are - as you said - replacable in groups as are Warriors, but they aren\'t really replacable on raids. That is what I would like to see for Warriors too: They should be the only viable raidtank, not because \"Warriors have always been that\", but because they ARE the most efficient at tanking there (bossmobs in this context) derived from AA skills...<br/>\n<br/>\nIf Warriors become the most efficient tanks overall again, Knights won\'t be chosen in groups anymore, the weak solo skills cannot closely counter that, we are by no means good soloers, even worse with PoP...<br/>\n<br/>\nShay</t>','cfb9a8f83493bd0665ea5cc35f444aaa',0,'','1stfplly',1,0,'',0,0,0,1,0,'',0),(825,205,37,51,0,'68.61.123.121',1506530283,0,1,1,1,1,'','Re: Epic question','<t>Re: Epic question	  #1	[-]<br/>\n avatar<br/>\n<br/>\nPosts: 0<br/>\nMar 31 03 4:44 AM<br/>\nReply Quote More<br/>\nMy Recent Posts<br/>\nYep, just put it back in the scabbard and hit combinde again.<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Mad Go-Go Dancer</t>','f31d1a68ddc78c70480f6186f1426262',0,'','3ecnh65b',1,0,'',0,0,0,1,0,'',0),(826,205,37,51,0,'68.61.123.121',1506530292,0,1,1,1,1,'','Re: Epic question','<t>Re: Epic question	  #2	[-]<br/>\n avatar<br/>\n<br/>\nPosts: 0<br/>\nMar 31 03 7:28 AM<br/>\nReply Quote More<br/>\nMy Recent Posts<br/>\nOr.. make your 2hs, place it in a bag.

Nerfing Knights on the other side would be a tough game even more, as I see them not being adequate for their guild\'s xp-huntinggrounds then anymore.<br/>\nThat\'s why I suggested a better taunt for them from like 50 or 55 on, be it with a hatecomponent on the general kick skill or lesser EB weapons that drop in areas like Velks Lower Dogs, Sebilis Juggs, Gorenaire - you get the point. With a better taunt, the tanking for xp groups should be balanced again, everything else, like HP/AC/Avoid/Mitig changes, would too easily unbalance it all again. Knights shouldn\'t become \"Last Resort\" tanks again. <br/>\nThe only other point I see Warriors having a problem, is their raid role, especially if they don\'t tank, on raids they should be the best tank by a larger degree than is. <br/>\nThere would be lots of factors to test: (on a either/or base)<br/>\n- Innate or AA based Avoid/Mitig boost against stronger mobs, 1% per level the mob is above the PC to a 5% or 10% max<br/>\n- group atk/str boost discipline<br/>\n- far enhanced /shield feature (scaled up through levels or an addittional group version)<br/>\n- ...<br/>\n<br/>\nThe point really is: Knights do not deserve it to be so distant 2nd that they are last resort for choice as tanks. If a group stays at zin, shouting for a tank while leaving the Knight next to them in the dust, something is wrong. As of now they would invite the Warrior or the Knight equally, only influenced on personal preferences which also are evened out throughout the player base though (if not they are in favor of Warriors yet).<br/>\n<br/>\nShay</t>','78f9e34603c62bed1917a59fbb4d32d3',0,'','35l0bnts',1,0,'',0,0,0,1,0,'',0),(832,195,3,52,0,'198.86.16.250',1506530338,0,1,1,1,1,'','Re: Dear developer team: One knight\'s view of Warriors.','<t>\"You know we were talking @#%$ in gc the other night about balancing the<br/>\nclasses.

If so, you do tank better than a Knight that did it comparably, you have about 10% more HP/AC, better values in dodge, parry, riposte and such, and you DO about 10% more DPS if in the same role. Of course you cannot compare your DPS while tanking to a not tanking, dps focused Knight.<br/>\nIf you wouldn\'t, why do you think all guilds left and right let their Warriors tank on raids? I have also seen xp groups have 61, 62 Warriors tank over me at 65, they weren\'t even in higher tier guilds.<br/>\n<br/>\nQuote:<br/>\nWe are not overly desired for groups and there isn\'t anything we are well suited to do on our own.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is not Warriors that aren\'t desired for groups, it is Tanks, because groups only need one, ask Clerics and Enchanters, they will sit around if all 5 man groups have one of them as well. Knights aren\'t chosen over Warriors for the MT spot neither. As for soloing, you rock at raids as all other specialists. (Combo reply to the other above poster) The classes that are strong at soloing (except Shamans who are strong and desired everywhere), what are they? Magicians, Druids, Wizards, Necromancers? They are almost never a stay-or-go for raids, only maybe if a certain spell from them is needed which isn\'t often, there are tons of raids though where no certain specialist = no raid. So if you want to become as powerfull as soloers as the traditional solo classes (Knights haven\'t reached that level themselves by far btw), you will have to grant them to be as powerfull, defining, needed as you or Clerics or Enchanters on a raid.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can just repeat, I\'ve seen Rogues at 60 solo in FG with a Fungi, you can do as well, maybe it needs a bit better gear than you have now though so time will bring that pleasure. \"There is no xp to be achieved anymore since PoP\" you say?

If a Shadow Knight has mana I think the Warrior will actually be doing less damage than the SK. I also find it hard to believe it when you say Warriors have 10% more AC since once you hit velious and beyond the available gear is close or in fact is identical.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, the previous point made was not that Warriors don\'t have some advantages to Knights but rather that those advantages they do have aren\'t significant enough in most group scenarios to make up for the functionaliy, utility, and ability to lock agro pretty solidly that they lose. Yes Warriors are better in some areas. However those areas where they are weak they are very very weak, while those areas where they are strong they are only slightly stronger. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis of course doesn\'t include their functionality on a raid, where at least the MT has a chance to really shine. While the rest of the Warriors stand back and do marginal damage. While its better than Paladin damage, we don\'t have any other compensating utility until the MT goes down. Its a one dimensional character which only one person at a time really gets to play in that dimension.<br/>\n<br/>\nQuote:<br/>\nI\'ve seen Rogues at 60 solo in FG with a Fungi, you can do as well, maybe it needs a bit better gear than you have now though so time will bring that pleasure.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAny class can solo if they\'ve managed to aquire enough of the right gear. However to gear up a Warrior and/or a Rogue to solo is much more difficult than to gear up either of the Knights to solo as well. The Knights have tools that add to their soloability that Warriors completely lack. Fearing, rooting, snaring, healing, buffing, doting, life tapping, these things make soloing much more possible with much less gear than a pure melee class. Do Knights really solo all that well any more? Probably not once they get into the 60+ area. But they certainly solo much better at all levels with much less gear than a Warrior.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd the compensation for the Warrior for this lack on his/her part is not more attractiveness for groups. You\'ve said it yourself, all three of the plate classes are about equally desireable, more or less.

Sure, I can MT in a group if the spot is open, but by doing so I reduce my utility be alot. If I\'m mt\'ing I can\'t do add control, my heals are interuppted more and I can\'t really switch targets to do the long cast time heals. Being MT is doable, but it sucks so bad. I prefer to have a 2ndry role in a group. I use my versatility to make sure the group stays alive thru good and bad pulls. This leads to the dps subject. Some think that the difference in damage output isn\'t great enough between warriors and knights. Well, for paladins that difference is just about right. If I\'m not tank then what do I bring to a group to help kill mobs faster. Sure I can heal and contribute on bad pulls, but those don\'t happen every pull. If a pull is good and there is only one mob to kill what does a paladin bring? Well, the answer is added damage. If you make it so we do even less damage when compared to the other classes then groups will not want us for our utility. The only thing they will want us for is the ability we have to tank.

I calculated the numbers in those days, even including Healing Wave of Prexus, rezzes, buffs and came to a number of like 18% I think. Still 80% from one class + 20% of another doesn\'t make a 100% class in terms of usefullness for the situations it is exposed to. This game is catering specialist classes, with 6 specialists (War, Cle, Enc, Rog, Mnk, Wiz/Rog/Shm) you could achieve far greater things and still can than with a versatility class group (e.g. Pal, Dru, Brd, Ran, SK, Bst). At least you need far less skilled players for some of the roles which are hard to find.<br/>\nA skill that is under 80% powerful of the specialist\'s skill is useless by the way. Groups just will not take you for that spot anymore - we all have seen it pre-melee patches. This doesn\'t say that Knights should only have 80% tank skills of Warriors, it would leave them at the frontier of tank-desirebility, and it is a very hard job to balance that right for VI...<br/>\n<br/>\nQuote:<br/>\n\"post from Frodlin7th\"<br/>\n<br/>\n1. yes, as long as we have mana, there is another stun at 64, but that is even more mana consuming, you don\'t say that we are heavily relying on Clerics (as you do) AND on Enchanters / Beast Lords, Bards / etc.<br/>\nWith a Warrior as tank you have the choice to just take a Shaman as slower in PoP, with a Knight you\'re nearly Forced to have an Enchanter, else the Knight will be oom, taunts worse, has less HP, heals less than a Warrior, making the Warrior clearly more attractive...<br/>\n<br/>\n2. Yet again, mana dependancy. Though you\'re basically right, Your hit points cannot wear off in the middle of a fight, ask Shadow Knights how they get 500 HP over Warrior-tanked-groups as well.<br/>\nI am not sure if it really is ignored every time, I usually see comparisons of either unbuffed or raid buffed tank classes...<br/>\n<br/>\n3. Every heal we cast in groups means downtime on the other side, or less stuns for taunting next mob, which makes mob bouncing more likely again. A Paladin healing performs his \"raid role\", which is not being MT, thus, if used too often, makes it impossible for him to be MT (or forces a med break).<br/>\nAgain, see how good Shadow Knights can heal...<br/>\n<br/>\nQuote:<br/>\nThere is NO AC difference that has ever been shown to matter, and even then, until elemental armors (where there IS a tiny difference) the best equipment is usable by both warriors and knights.<br/>\n<br/>\nHitpoint/Stamina spread has been reduced from a 3/2 ratio to a 4/3 ratio above 255.<br/>\n<br/>\nFinally, and MOST importantly, healing a single group member is ALWAYS both easier and more efficient than healing multiple group members, which means reliable aggro = MORE mana efficient than an *extremely* slight difference in defensive capabilities/HP pool. <br/>\n<br/>\nI\'m beginning to be of a mind that warriors are LESS balanced with knights than they were pre-PoP.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn xp groups similar HP/AC is a good thing, people give each tank class the same chance to be their tank that way, all have equal chances - cannot be more fair. No, because you are specialist does not justify you getting groups more than we do, only our tanking gets us into groups, the other skills aren\'t by far sufficientto do that.<br/>\nThe power gap in tanking SHOULD be more visible on raids though, and to do that while not touching the xp group play, one could only do it via AA (at least there are no other ways that come to my mind atm).<br/>\nAnd, as someone other said, the lack in taunting is too much to actually make up for that small HP/AC advantage. This is what the thread is all about: To show the dev team (who hopefully read this board) from the perspective of one knight (me :p ) that Warriors are NOT fine, as they said, but need two things:<br/>\n<br/>\n1. Better Taunt abilities before they can lay their hands on Enraging Blow weapons (that add 700 hate, right?), be it a taunt component on the general kick skill (would make some classes really thing about if they should actually kick anymore on raids), be it lesser Enraging Blow proc weapons (something that adds about 350 hate per proc should be ok for the 55+ pre-superuber game), be it that a failed Tauntskill check still adds \"level x4\" hate. It is not fun for other classes to control their agro so much more with a Warrior than with other classes, it basically only means to sit around more than half the battle and do nothing or run on far less than full potential.<br/>\n<br/>\n2. A defining raid role, be it a far better raid-tankability, group enhancing discs/AAs or whatever. Warriors as specialists will never be more fun than others specialists on raids though I fear, Clerics that are not in the CH chain do not have the most thrilling job neither, Enchanters that are not main-mezzer or -buffer aren\'t the most kicking class neither. I am not saying that it SHOULD be like this, every player deserves fun with the class he likes best, it is only hard to limit some skills to raids, balancewise.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI started this threat from the perspective of a Paladin, one Paladin, to state that I see the need for certain improvements for Warriors. I also would like to increase the sensability for the needs of my class and Shadow Knights. The improvements Warriors get may not go into a direction influencing the xp-group game in a way, that Warriors get more than 1/3rd tank spots in groups again.<br/>\nFor xp groups I see small tweaks needed in the taunt section.<br/>\nFor raids I see the need for some fun / class defining AA (three sec Enrage, bossmob-mitig/avoid advantage, ...)<br/>\nFor solo-abilities... well... I do not really care if Warriors get something there, if so, more power to them, not more than Monks had before the nerf please though and not more than the Knights have now.

Using the new psuedo CH spell for druid/shammy as an example, I think SOE is trying to make the \"hybrid\" classes more attractive to groups and this is their plan. I say \"hybrid\" because I see druids and shaman as \"hybrids\" to clerics only in the realm of healing. They give up the ability to heal like the pure class of cleric in order to be able to do other things better than a cleric. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, before the patch that introduced this spell, clerics had to be more attractive to groups than druids and shaman because grouping was their only reliable means of exp gain, while druids and shaman could solo. If you notice, since druids and shaman have received greater healing ability, clerics have received greater solo ability so that they do have an alternate option for exp from groups. As example, my 57 cleric friend, in moderate gear, can self buff himself to almost pally/sk level hit points/ac, uses his proc hammer, and can bash stun to get time to root mob if need be. He can and does solo blues for exp. <br/>\n<br/>\nI think that this sets a precedent with SOE\'s class balancing. They are saying that when they make the \"hybrid\'s\" abilities closer to the pure class\'s for better group possibilities, they need to give the pure class another option other than grouping for exp gain, (ie solo ability, not top ability like nec/druid, but ability to gain exp while waiting for a group).<br/>\n<br/>\nI think we could all agree that the hp/ac gap between warriors and pally/sks ad shrunk dramatically, even at mid levels. Acryllia plate armor can be worn by all 3 classes, and it\'s pretty much the best stuff attainable for all 3 classes at say level 40. In the high level game, that huge flux of all/all armor, or at least all plate class armor, has helped keep the gap to be ever shrinking. <br/>\n<br/>\nClerics are the pure healers, warriors are the pure tanks. Clerics lose their dominance over being healer in a group and gain innate spells/abilities to increase soloability in the same patch. Warriors lose our dominance over being the tank in the group and we get /shield. I love the skill, but it\'s still a group orientated skill, and does not help us otherwise. <br/>\n<br/>\nI do agree with your post Shay, I like the idea of all three tank classes having the same chance for group, as I like the idea for all three healers to as well. I\'ve been in groups that disbanded after 30 minutes of shouting for a cleric while a druid was LFG, I do not see that as fair to the druid or the group, that they must have a cleric. But, that is dependent upon each of the three classes having some alternate means to gain exp besides grouping. I sit at the zone in to Seb LFG and watch pally/sk/ranger/monk soloing the entrance spawns for exp while they are LFG as well. Admittedly, 2 hours will go by and the hybrid may have only gained a blue of exp, but all that time I\'ve only gained a higher score in gems. <E>:)</E> I have one pally friend who soloed from 43 to 49 in less than a week in City of Mist, and this was pre SOV. Another pally friend who got left an exp group at 49 and never got into another group for exp until 62, he soloed the rest, and this is w/out spending 50k plus on gear to be able to solo. I will admit I am jealous of the paladin and sk abilities to solo, even though I know it\'s not nearly as efficient as druid/nec soloing, and it does make me bitter and hard to talk about class balance when I get passed up for groups for the pally who is soloing right in front of me. So please understand why we warriors react the way we do to issues of class balance. We know that hybrids are not the uber soloers in EQ, we know you deserve the right to be useful/wanted in groups, but we also know you have other options to gain exp after you\'ve been LFG for 2 plus hours, we do not with out greatly sacrifing our tank gear to go and buy Fungi, TOD, etc...to be able to solo. <br/>\n<br/>\nGo out and price a 12/23 with a few stats but no taunt proc, then price Frost Bringer. You\'ll find the price almost always triples or more, just because the proc on the item is good for taunt. Warriors must spend huge amounts of coin just to come close to being able to hold taunt. If we spend the money to get decent gear to be able to solo somewhat, we will not have funds to be able to tank worth anything. <br/>\n<br/>\nWarriors see the class balancing moving more towards everyone being just as useful at their role as the \"pure\" classes, so all can get groups, but our own abilities having no change to balance out. I\'m not upset over the paladin who gets a group over me, we both would bring something different to that group, and the group wanted what the paladin brings. I am upset because I have no other option for exp than to group, while the paladin does. SOE has put warriors on a different standard than they have clerics when it comes to balancing us with our hybrids, and this makes being a warrior very hard and trying. <br/>\n<br/>\nRolfgaar Ulvarviga<br/>\n55 Myrmidon</r>','9f42f90a844f04021e7fc4b1b0fcb0e7',0,'','1ztwva79',1,0,'',0,0,0,1,0,'',0),(855,206,37,51,0,'68.61.123.121',1506530535,0,1,1,1,1,'','Re: halfling druid master\'s head','<t>halfling druid master\'s head	  #3	[-]<br/>\n avatar<br/>\n<br/>\nPosts: 0<br/>\nApr 19 03 5:00 PM<br/>\nReply Quote More<br/>\nMy Recent Posts<br/>\nok thx)</t>','7ae46c024b372a6820ee7b267b05874f',0,'','1m0q5dmt',1,0,'',0,0,0,1,0,'',0),(856,195,3,52,0,'198.86.16.250',1506530552,0,1,1,1,1,'','Re: Dear developer team: One knight\'s view of Warriors.','<t>Quote:<br/>\n\"Wrong, that was post Kunark, in the melee patches the 80-90% figure came up. 75% was in regards that we were thought to be 25% Clerics which we never were. I calculated the numbers in those days, even including Healing Wave of Prexus, rezzes, buffs and came to a number of like 18% I think. Still 80% from one class + 20% of another doesn\'t make a 100% class in terms of usefullness for the situations it is exposed to. This game is catering specialist classes, with 6 specialists (War, Cle, Enc, Rog, Mnk, Wiz/Rog/Shm) you could achieve far greater things and still can than with a versatility class group (e.g. Pal, Dru, Brd, Ran, SK, Bst). At least you need far less skilled players for some of the roles which are hard to find.<br/>\nA skill that is under 80% powerful of the specialist\'s skill is useless by the way. Groups just will not take you for that spot anymore - we all have seen it pre-melee patches. This doesn\'t say that Knights should only have 80% tank skills of Warriors, it would leave them at the frontier of tank-desirebility, and it is a very hard job to balance that right for VI...\"<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSomehow I have trouble believing that paladins are less than 20% cleric at this point. Looking at head-to-head comparisions, the top paladin spells are around level 50ish cleric spells. I hardly see the \"20%\" cleric aspect you\'re talking about. Can you please explain how you decipher that Paladins are 18% cleric, considering hteir res is 6% less, and the spells used by eitehr class have a 13 level or less difference?<br/>\n<br/>\nYour theory about how a skill is 80% as useful serves no purpose is utter BS. A beastlord\'s slows are less than 80% of a shamans, but beastlords are still useful. A druid still can\'t heal anywhere near 80% of a cleric\'s healing ability, but they still groups as healers. Properly played, a rogue is far below 80% of the damage output of mages/necros/rangers (in some cases), but rogues seem to get groups somehow. If hybrids were only 80% warriors, I could understand your argument. But this is simply not the case. <br/>\n<br/>\nYour \"game\" catered around \"Specialists\" idea is really a load of BS. This is just not the case. War, Cle, enc, Monk, Rogue, Wiz/Shm; this isn\'t the law of EQ anymore. It hasn\'t been since SoL. If you still believe this is the law of EQ, then there will never be balance. Warriors aren\'t the most efficient tank class, Rogues are too 1-dimmensional, monks don\'t parse out enough damage, etc. THe best group I\'ve been in thus far has consisted of:<br/>\n<br/>\nCleric, War, Rogue (later ranger), Beastlord, Necro, Wizard (later mage)<br/>\n<br/>\nThis group parsed out MASSIVE damage, a lot more than your \"traditional\" group would. The game has evolved. The only things that haven\'t changed about that scenario; clerics are still the heavily preffered healing class, and chanters/shamans are still heavily preffered because of slow. Otherwise, the remaining myths about the ideal group are simply that, myths, not fact.<br/>\n<br/>\nQuote:<br/>\n\"yes, as long as we have mana, there is another stun at 64, but that is even more mana consuming, you don\'t say that we are heavily relying on Clerics (as you do) AND on Enchanters / Beast Lords, Bards / etc.<br/>\nWith a Warrior as tank you have the choice to just take a Shaman as slower in PoP, with a Knight you\'re nearly Forced to have an Enchanter, else the Knight will be oom, taunts worse, has less HP, heals less than a Warrior, making the Warrior clearly more attractive...\"<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI\'m just curious. Last time I checked, paladins also have disarm, and a taunt skill that caps around 200. They also have a VERY wide array of 2-handers that can maintain agro VERY well due to nice delay and proc. How much spell-casting is required exactly, considering you can get initial agro through an item-based cast, such as stun from a DW bracer (resists still gain just as much agro, just no effect). How much spell-casting is required to get agro, considering the real battle is establishing it, not maintaining? What, one stun? two? do you even always need it? Where exactly is this massive expenditure of mana coming from?<br/>\n<br/>\nFurthermore, speaking about your reliance on classes. Warriors have to rely on classes just as much as you. Besides the fact that we are equally reliant on chanters and clerics for somewhat different reasons, we also have to rely on the ENTIRE GROUP to watch their agro. Hybrids don\'t share this burden nearly as much. Therefore, a hybrid can achieve a lot more effectiveness out of their group than a warrior because the remaining classes don\'t have to be as concerned with their agro.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nQuote:<br/>\n\"In xp groups similar HP/AC is a good thing, people give each tank class the same chance to be their tank that way, all have equal chances - cannot be more fair. No, because you are specialist does not justify you getting groups more than we do, only our tanking gets us into groups, the other skills aren\'t by far sufficientto do that.<br/>\nThe power gap in tanking SHOULD be more visible on raids though, and to do that while not touching the xp group play, one could only do it via AA (at least there are no other ways that come to my mind atm).<br/>\nAnd, as someone other said, the lack in taunting is too much to actually make up for that small HP/AC advantage. This is what the thread is all about: To show the dev team (who hopefully read this board) from the perspective of one knight (me ) that Warriors are NOT fine, as they said, but need two things:\"<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYou still seem to be missing the same point people keep bringing up OVER and OVER here, that you seem to be ignoring. Just because you are not selected into groups for your spell-casting ability doesn\'t mean that these spells don\'t exist. And it ALSO means that groups will choose hybrids over warriors BECAUSE they have those spells. Unless you\'re in a healing-intensive, or Crowd-Control intensive group, any of those abilities are usefull. Hell, a wizard/druids evac ability isn\'t used often, but you damn well better believe that\'s one aspect that gets them groups.<br/>\n<br/>\nQuote:<br/>\n\"Please let me be also desired as tank, I want to help you and not suicide...\"<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nDon\'t feed us this. Hybrids are already desired as tanks, sometimes moreso than warriors. Please, understand that warriors becoming better tanks is the way things were supposed to be originally. We\'re SUPPOSED to be the best tank class because that\'s ALL WE CAN DO. There\'s nothing else warriors are good for if not tanking, nothing. Us being better tanks still won\'t give us the same versatility that hybrids have. THere will still be cases that hybrids are chosen for groups, because your spells still exist. Deny them if you will, but this won\'t nullify their presence. <br/>\n<br/>\nUnderstand, in every other class in the game, there is still a \"king\" for that class, the best class to fill that position. They are the clear kings in this specific area. THis exists in healing, evaccing, melee damage, caster damage, pulling, Crowd-Control, slowing, etc. There is a king, a preferred class in every category. Yet, the other classes in every catergory still get into groups because they bring other things to the table. Tanking is the only exception to the \"king\" rule at the moment.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe bottom line at this point is, The 10% gap between warriors and hybrids isn\'t justified by the spell-casting ability of the tank classes. The fact that you continue to argue that each class should have equal opportunity to fulfill the tank role further shifts the balance away from the warrior class. In my opinion, there are a couple of things that should be implemented, to fix not only warriors, but some other melee classes as well.<br/>\n<br/>\n- 10% melee damage increase for warrior/ranger/monks. Warriors I\'ve already explained, the 10% gap isn\'t balanced at the moment. Rangers because they fall far behind warriors in damage-mitigation, well below knights. They should be on par with warriors offensively because there is already a very large defensive gap. MOnks because the gap in damage between monks and warrior/ranger is narrowed further, this will further decrease the already severely lowered utility of monks.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Separate mitigation table. I think warriors have been desiring this since the beggining. We are supposed to be defensive specialists. Any other specialist melee class has separate tables; monks, rogues, etc. We are the ONLY specialist class that shares our primary ability tables with anyone else. Put warriors on a separate mitigation table. Have us mitigate 10-15% more damage than every other class, and strike that evil /disc defensive. This band-aid that we have to separate us as tanks is an emergency utility, no different than LoH, and it\'s simply not getting the job done.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Fix taunt up a bit. Nothing major, our jobs shouldn\'t be that easy, nor should our taunt be anywhere near the abilities of other classes. <br/>\n<br/>\n- Raise the piercing cap for warrior/ranger to 250. This is just ridiculous at this point. So many piercers in the game, even warrior-only ones and ranger ones, and we have a shitty cap on the skill.<br/>\nWilhelmm D\'averam<br/>\nWarlord of the Apocalypse<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWilhelmm\'s Profile</t>','997a29a49e79690ac4d9c66947b80548',0,'','1yf3sbow',1,0,'',0,0,0,1,0,'',0),(857,207,37,51,0,'68.61.123.121',1506530559,0,1,1,1,1,'','Eyepatch of Plunder','<t>Lead	[-]<br/>\n avatar<br/>\n<br/>\nPosts: 0<br/>\nApr 13 03 3:30 PM<br/>\nReply Quote More<br/>\nMy Recent Posts<br/>\nTAGS : None<br/>\n<br/>\nAny advice on how to do it?<br/>\nBaruch the Barbarian Bastard <br/>\n<br/>\nBabyblade the Froglok Bitch</t>','0beaaa724d43cf0302fcb94554d4925e',0,'','1bafr4c7',1,0,'',0,0,0,1,0,'',0),(858,195,3,52,0,'198.86.16.250',1506530566,0,1,1,1,1,'','Re: Dear developer team: One knight\'s view of Warriors.','<t>I\'m not going to dissect the entire argument.... but will say this:<br/>\n<br/>\nYour contention that your ability to hold aggro is suject to having an enchanter in your group is specious.

And the other 55 warrior who posted about solo ability before.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn my opinion we should have AT LEAST one of the following, or some mix between the 3 :<br/>\n<br/>\n1. Better tanking abilities for exp groups, I mean not UBER INNATE tanking abilities, but it SHOULD be noticeable just by eye that a warrior tanks better than a knight, without pulling out parsers, formulas and that kind of @#%$ to just find out a 10% difference in damage absorption. The idea of a separate warrior specific damage mitigation table sounds great.<br/>\n<br/>\n2. If VI or whoever decides about balancing issues decides that the point definately cannot be considered, THEN we should get some versatility, something more to add to the group than just tanking. It could be obtained by the discipline way (for example by putting each disc on a DIFFERENT timer so you could use them in group situations, or, by reducing disc reuse timers greatly), or by the AA way (such lame things like rampage or warcry could be turned into something REALLY useful, for example, just a thought, warcry could make the whole group go into \"berserker mode\" for an amount of time, or give some kind of haste, or whatever, but actually USEFUL, not just a lame fear resistance). Also, warriors could get something in the area of crowd control (maybe some stunning CONTROLLED attack) OR in terms of DPS (like a fixed aggressive disc)<br/>\n<br/>\n3.

This is seriously quite bullshit in my opinion. The gap should be larger, considering how much we\'re giving up to be warriors, in regards to agro and spells<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThis actually isn\'t true at the top end. I do about 85% of the dps of our warriors without offense oriented AA and I use goldenrod. If you compare paladins with full AA spread vs warrior with full AA spread it gets worse. The big issue is its a lot easier to find top end 2h weapons over the 2 top end 1h weapons you need for warrior dps, not to mention the taunting weapon.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nQuote:<br/>\nknights are supposed to be doing 75% of warriors dps, just fyi~<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThis isn\'t true. Knights are supposed to be doing 80% of a warriors melee DPS, which is actually pretty accurate. Take a warrior with a sword of ssra and a paladin with same weapon and the dps of the paladin is actually around 80% of the warriors if the paladin doesn\'t load his proc spell. We get spells to augment our dps, paladins only get a proc spell but SK\'s get quite a few spells.<br/>\n<br/>\nQuote:<br/>\nYour argument that Paladins, who represent 11% of the tanking population should get 33% of the tanking spots, and shadowknights who represent 4% of the tanking population should get 33% of the tanking spots is also flawed<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThis isn\'t flawed just mistated. If there is a SK, Pal, War all sitting at zone LFG and you need a tank they each should have an equal chance of getting the group. I feel its true right now. Sometimes you are hunting in places like BoT and the warrior just makes a better tank(at least given our guilds gear/AA levels), sometimes you are hunting undead or really need aggro in whcih case the SK/Pal are better, sometimes you need the SK for pulling. If it reaches a point where the warrior is always picked over the SK/Pal in this situation, the Paladin will never get a group, low healing, low dps aggro generaters are really only good for tanking in a group.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThis entire post comes down to the perceptions of where balance is now. The paladins and shadow knights that have posted here seem to agree with the warriors on where balance should be. The difference is they think that is where balance is now and warriors don\'t. Warriors do 10-20% more DPS than paladins, they tank 5-10% than a paladin and they hold aggro well enough for the groups I\'m in. This is probably going to be different for everyone based on the groups you tend to get, their gear, AA etc. The tanking part is my personal perceptions, I haven\'t tested it, the DPS part I\'ve tested to death with warriors in my guild. The tanking part is just how it works in my circle or friends, the warriors are aware of the issue, they wish they taunted a little better but it in no way stops anyone from groupnig with them. I\'ve never once seen a warrior turned down for a group because they wanted a pal/sk to hold aggro.<br/>\n<br/>\nFraustkilicus, Halfling Paladin</t>','575a73574ee4a350a57618767d7cc423',0,'','19ggmoao',1,0,'',0,0,0,1,0,'',0),(869,195,3,52,0,'198.86.16.250',1506530702,0,1,1,1,1,'','Re: Dear developer team: One knight\'s view of Warriors.','<t>Adding a bit more to this.<br/>\n<br/>\nWarriors not in the best guilds need help with agro.

I\'m setup for a balance of hp/ac/wis/mana. The warriors in my guild easily have 1k more hp\'s then me. Raid buffed I hit 6kish hp\'s, 1250ish ac, and 3200ish mana. Warriors are hitting 1350ish ac, 7kish hp\'s.

I don\'t want to be main tank anymore. I like to be able to add dps, but also be able to retain some ability to take damage when needed. I would not feel threatened by warriors being able to hold agro better then what they can currently. I still would have a job in groups. I could use a boost in dps to make myself a little more wanted, but I doubt that would happen. Maybe a fast refresh disc (under 10mins) that gives added dps at the cost of defensive ability. Then we could bring dps to a group, but at the cost of being a tank. Maybe make it a turn on/off skill like slay undead was gonna be. Not sure, just a thought is all.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor raids, warriors could use a few more skills. Have some skills that refresh fast enough they can use them in different fights. An AE type attack for the massive pulls where a guild ae\'s everything. Put the crit disc on a much reduced refresh timer. That would be fun to see more often.

The numbers were also based on a 50 man raid environment, because one usually has Clerics there as well as all other classes. Of course in a group without Cleric, a Paladin is more Cleric than 20%. One example from the numbers: a Cleric with CH (assuming a high HP tank, over 5000 Cleric mana with low regen, but no Healing Adept AA) can heal about 135000 HP for an entire mana bar while a Paladin with WoM (4300 mana, low regen, no HA) tops at about 17340 HP healed IF the entire group gets wounded. Before you say \"CH never really lands for 7500 HP\", this is a theoretical figure, it could be even worse for Paladins if I used Clerics with group CH, healing 5x 7500 and 1x maybe 3000 HP per cast under model circumstances.<br/>\n<br/>\nQuote:<br/>\nYour theory about how a skill is 80% as useful serves no purpose is utter BS. A beastlord\'s slows are less than 80% of a shamans, but beastlords are still useful. A druid still can\'t heal anywhere near 80% of a cleric\'s healing ability, but they still groups as healers. Properly played, a rogue is far below 80% of the damage output of mages/necros/rangers (in some cases), but rogues seem to get groups somehow. If hybrids were only 80% warriors, I could understand your argument. But this is simply not the case.<br/>\n<br/>\nHm, a BL slows for 65% max, a Shaman slows for - I think - up to 80%: 65/80*100 = 81,25% or MORE than 80%, i.e. usefull.<br/>\nIn a group that doesn\'t need the versatility of the Cleric in fast heals (see me asking for taunt upgrades for Warriors), assuming a CH lands for 5k HP on uber players, a Druid with KR (ratio 7.8 hp/mana) heals 62.4% as good as a Cleric with CH (ratio 12.5 hp/mana). I think I said somewhere in this thread that I do not consider the healer spot choices (Cle/Dru/Shm) quite balanced yet, even more considering that a Druid really cannot do anymore (like nuke to add DPS) if he is MH of a group.<br/>\nAbout the Rogue DPS being 80% of caster DPS... Maybe I am not very up-to-date on that one, but I really ponder where that number comes from, I always thought it might be equal or Rogue having a slight advantage. Anyways, the Rogue for his DPS only needs the back of a mob, the casters need Mana and the chance to get out their pet, the Ranger needs a wide open area where no pixel of the mob is stuck in some environment and free sight - AND cannot maintain it because TS wears off pretty fast.<br/>\n<br/>\nQuote:<br/>\nTHe best group I\'ve been in thus far has consisted of:<br/>\n<br/>\nCleric, War, Rogue (later ranger), Beastlord, Necro, Wizard (later mage)<br/>\n<br/>\nSee? That was one of my points, Cleric for healer, most efficient, one of 3 possible tanks, here the one without need for mana regen WHILE only little mana regen is in place, then a lot DPS, typical for PoP. PoP not everywhere needs crowd control, but still, you could have upped your DPS a lot with a Enc instead of a BL, just from Haste and C4 or C5. 3 DPS dealers with an Enc are better than 4 DPS dealers with no Enc in my eyes, and with a Hybrid tank you NEED the Enc even more, or you have downtime every few pulls.<br/>\n<br/>\nQuote:<br/>\nHow much spell-casting is required to get agro, considering the real battle is establishing it, not maintaining? What, one stun? two? do you even always need it? Where exactly is this massive expenditure of mana coming from?<br/>\n<br/>\nThat comes from the view of a Warrior clearly, as for Knights, the battle does not establish agro, you have nearly no other choice than hoping for mana connecting attacks with hopefully as many procs as possible after a successfull taunt to build up a agro surplus to the group. A Knight establishes agro and maintains it with spells, some Paladins do the job with only 2 stuns, yes, but then they move on a very slim line to lose it. Personally I cast 4 to 5 Stuns per battle, and a few more FoA stuns if Heals / Slow seem to land late. DW Bracer? forget it, it is quite hard to channel that long cast time through even slowed PoP beating.<br/>\n<br/>\nQuote:<br/>\n...we also have to rely on the ENTIRE GROUP to watch their agro.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the age of EB weapons that is not the case anymore, I\'ve seen and been told.

Just because you are not selected into groups for your spell-casting ability doesn\'t mean that these spells don\'t exist.

Let me tell you again, we do NOT get groups because of our spells (heals, buffs, rezzes in this context, Stuns are more our taunt). This shall be no flame, but I rather think that you seem to be ignoring the fact that groups need a tank if they choose between War/Pal/SK. They will look at the spells if a Cleric is missing, if they need a weak mob tanked, whatever.<br/>\n<br/>\nQuote:<br/>\nUnderstand, in every other class in the game, there is still a \"king\" for that class, the best class to fill that position.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd that EXACTLY is the sickness of this game, the basic misbalance. For everything one class can do, a group could go better with the \"King class\", versatility means jack, it is only good to counter lack of skills.<br/>\nThe game supports to few roles far too much: DPS, tanking, healing, crowdcontrol and lowering of relative mob-DPS by buffs and slow. Any class that is not king (or 80% within range of the king) gets not chosen for the spot if needed. Look at Druids: they heal 60% as good as Clerics and their DPS isn\'t that loved neither. They are chosen if the group doupts in their skills, for backup heals and evac, a bit DPS if the other stuff is not needed. They are still not chosen for any of the spots in the regular xp game if the kings are in range.<br/>\nEnchanters still are holy kings on their spot, Clerics are as well though they have some competition on the horizon already, ONLY Warriors are the specialists that have to already compete for their spot in a equal game. If it were for all those specialists as it is for Warriors now, it would be fair and balanced.

Think about a Warrior with EB weapons (able to hold agro quite well) with 20% more HP. Should your guild\'s Knights quit the game once the Warriors have their EB or what?

Warriors need a few tweaks, that\'s what this thread is about, but tanking itself as core supported ability in EQ (a game with THREE supposed tank classes) was never more balanced.

Therefor we deserve the same chance for groups, the core skill we offer is tanking, thus we need to be equal to Warriors in it.

The uber mob fights to reach those zones are much more difficult than actually fighting there. My guild wouldn\'t have a prayer against the Behemoth, but those of us now flagged for Drunder are doing fine fighting there and are very happy to have a new place to explore. We hadn\'t gotten around to HoH yet, but planned to when we were ready for another zone to explore. Torment was planned somewhere down the road from there. None of them would happen without the changes from the apr. 8th patch.

I guess it was made this way to bring some versatility. But what you are suggesting, Shay, is basically to make everyone equal. In your perfect EQ world, druids would be able to heal like a cleric and necros to mez like enchanters. And, of course, paladins, SKs and warriors even in tanking area (btw that\'s exactly the situation atm). Am I correct ?<br/>\n<br/>\nI wont extend the debate to that, I personnally think that people who dont like this conception of class balance should play an another game, designed in a way where each character would be similar to an another one. Hell, in every RPG a cleric is King at healing. In every RPG a warrior is a fukin warrior, the word only speaks for itself.<br/>\nQuote:<br/>\nTherefor we deserve the same chance for groups, the core skill we offer is tanking, thus we need to be equal to Warriors in it.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, basically, there is NO WAY for you to agree with Glatius or Frodin or me, because we see the game from different points of view. The debate should not be \"do warriors need upgrades ?\" but \"how to make an another game from the current one ?\". In my opinion, warriors HAVE to be clearly superior in tanking over hybrids, just because warriors are specialists and hybrids are hybrids. They should compensate their lacking in tanking abilities by their spells, they should not to be warriors with spells, cause it just screws warriors that way.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy first character ever was - guess what ? - an hybrid. It was a ranger, I didnt know how the game worked at all and wanted to play some \"Robin Hood like\" character. After I got level 6 I understood 2 things :<br/>\n<br/>\n1. In this game, you cannot kill a monster just with a bow. You need to tank and attack it with melee weapons.<br/>\n<br/>\n2. Hybrids must suck at meleeing, at least if compared to a warrior. Since it seems that the game is made in a way where ranged attacks are pretty useless, I want to melee and to be good at it. Therefore I have to play a specialist.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I deleted the ranger, made a warrior, and was happy to play him until all this Velious / SoL mess. And now I feel completely screwed because hybrids become as good as I am, without any improvements or compensations for me, as specialist. I bought a game where clerics were clerics and warriors were warriors. Now, this game is getting something where every healer is turning into a cleric and every tank turning into a warrior (to be caricatural, but not that much in fact). Specialists dont shine anymore, but still suck in the areas of the game where they sucked before. But, hybrids are becoming almost as good as specialists, dont loose their other abilities, get improvements, and are still not happy. I\'m jealous and bitter. I want my money back !!!<br/>\n<br/>\nViladdar Orcslayer - Teir\'Dal Warlord<br/>\n<br/>\nKINESIS</t>','db04b434b4b2e439dedb38a1ff534b12',0,'','120gswgb',1,0,'',0,0,0,1,0,'',0),(879,208,37,51,0,'68.61.123.121',1506530786,0,1,1,1,1,'','Re: Group Flagging for Alternate PoP advancement','<t>Re: ..	  #2	[-]<br/>\n avatar<br/>\n<br/>\nPosts: 0<br/>\nApr 17 03 1:58 AM<br/>\nReply Quote More<br/>\nMy Recent Posts<br/>\nword of advice, stay away from torment.

Warriors need a few tweaks, that\'s what this thread is about, but tanking itself as core supported ability in EQ (a game with THREE supposed tank classes) was never more balanced.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nNo actually its not balanced, which is why we\'re talking. If you mean to say that the three tank classes have a fairly equal chance of aquiring a spot in a group based solely on their ability to tank and control agro, then I\'d agree, that seems to be the case as it stands today.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, to make that possible the Knights have moved in on Warrior specialization to a significant degree. And Warriors have gotten jack and @#%$ while losing a lot of their attraction. Right now our only significant attraction is we do raid mobs well. Otherwise Warrior not only aren\'t any more attractive than a Knight (which you may argue is the preferred state of affairs) but we don\'t get any of the pretty bells and whistles of a Knight class.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow do they justify crippling us in so many ways compared to a Knight while at the same time making a Knight so close to matching our supposedly specialized abilities? Agro control is just the most glaring example of a problem. And before someone says well EB weapons fix that, only a very small percentage of Warriors ever get EB weapons. How about they make cease and desist as common as EB weapons and see how the Paladins like it?<br/>\n<br/>\nHit points - effectively the same, one or two more hits by a PoP mob, hardly a class definining difference.<br/>\n<br/>\nAC - effectively the same.<br/>\n<br/>\nAgro control - in favor of the Knight.<br/>\n<br/>\nMitigation - slightly in favor of the Warrior but not significantly enough that people really notice unless the encounter calls for the use of defensive.<br/>\n<br/>\nDPS - Roughly 20% more than a Knight.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd to offset the Warrior\'s small advantages (when grouping) the Knight gets stuns, heals, buffs, roots, and things like FoL or they get debuffs, life tapes, FD, DoTs, a pet, harm touch, snare and FoL.<br/>\n<br/>\nI\'m sorry it just doesn\'t add up. Our advantages are for the most part are relatively small these days. Our disadvantages on the other hand are huge. While in the over all scheme of things picking one tank out of a group off 3 might be fairly balanced the full functionality of the classes isn\'t, not by a long shot.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf we can\'t be significantly better is our area of specialization because of the negative impact it will on the grouping opportunities of the Knights then they should either have their greater utility reduced across the board or our utility should be increased across the board. If a tank is measured solely on being a tank and therefore the Knights have to be damn near the same level of tank as a Warrior to succeed, then being a Warrior specialist has no particular advantage and a whole pile of disadvantages.<br/>\nThe Man in Black: We are men of action, lies do not become us.</t>','db906230781d71c465550dd7a5dad846',0,'','19u2k1ys',1,0,'',0,0,0,1,0,'',0),(886,210,37,51,0,'68.61.123.121',1506530876,0,1,1,1,1,'','9th dwarf ring quest npc','<t>Lead	[-]<br/>\n avatar<br/>\n<br/>\nPosts: 0<br/>\nMar 28 03 8:14 AM<br/>\nReply Quote More<br/>\nMy Recent Posts<br/>\nTAGS : None<br/>\n<br/>\nAny way to fix faction without killing boss mobs in SS and Kael?<br/>\nVixel Pendreic<br/>\n62 Warlord<br/>\nGear <br/>\nDragon Maw</t>','c2f0fd1a1d0e10e8459e01a5e32c22f5',0,'','1rlum50l',1,0,'',0,0,0,1,0,'',0),(887,210,37,51,0,'68.61.123.121',1506530893,0,1,1,1,1,'','Re: 9th dwarf ring quest npc','<t>Re: 9th dwarf ring quest npc	  #1	[-]<br/>\n avatar<br/>\n<br/>\nPosts: 0<br/>\nMar 28 03 9:18 AM<br/>\nReply Quote More<br/>\nMy Recent Posts<br/>\n3 quests that I know of to help raise Dain faction, of course this is assuming that you are at least not KoS to Coldain.<br/>\n<br/>\n1) The Ring quests, redo rings 1 through 7<br/>\n<br/>\n2) The shawl quests, 1 and 2 are trivial, 3 is easy if you know a highly skilled baker<br/>\n<br/>\n3) The first part of the Pheno focus quest involves a dwarf in the thurg mines and a weapon smith near the bank.<br/>\n<br/>\nSadly the faction hits are very small, I started out max KoS to Dain and after doing ring 1 through 5, shawl 1, 2 about 10 times, and shawl 3 and 4 one time.

First off:<br/>\n<br/>\nQuote:<br/>\n\"That number was derived comparing the total Buffage/Heals/Rezzes per mana per time a Cleric could do and a Paladin could do. The numbers were also based on a 50 man raid environment, because one usually has Clerics there as well as all other classes. Of course in a group without Cleric, a Paladin is more Cleric than 20%. One example from the numbers: a Cleric with CH (assuming a high HP tank, over 5000 Cleric mana with low regen, but no Healing Adept AA) can heal about 135000 HP for an entire mana bar while a Paladin with WoM (4300 mana, low regen, no HA) tops at about 17340 HP healed IF the entire group gets wounded. Before you say \"CH never really lands for 7500 HP\", this is a theoretical figure, it could be even worse for Paladins if I used Clerics with group CH, healing 5x 7500 and 1x maybe 3000 HP per cast under model circumstances.\"<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, in a group with a cleric, a Paladin is more than 20% cleric. Of course parental class abilities are superior and often override paladins. What else did you expect? However, by your OWN admission, a paladin is more than 20% cleric without one in the group. Far more. Let\'s consider:<br/>\n<br/>\n- Rezzes: 90 vs 96 = WAY more than 20%<br/>\n- Buffs. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nQuote:<br/>\n\"Hm, a BL slows for 65% max, a Shaman slows for - I think - up to 80%: 65/80*100 = 81,25% or MORE than 80%, i.e. usefull.<br/>\nIn a group that doesn\'t need the versatility of the Cleric in fast heals (see me asking for taunt upgrades for Warriors), assuming a CH lands for 5k HP on uber players, a Druid with KR (ratio 7.8 hp/mana) heals 62.4% as good as a Cleric with CH (ratio 12.5 hp/mana). I think I said somewhere in this thread that I do not consider the healer spot choices (Cle/Dru/Shm) quite balanced yet, even more considering that a Druid really cannot do anymore (like nuke to add DPS) if he is MH of a group.<br/>\nAbout the Rogue DPS being 80% of caster DPS... Maybe I am not very up-to-date on that one, but I really ponder where that number comes from, I always thought it might be equal or Rogue having a slight advantage. Anyways, the Rogue for his DPS only needs the back of a mob, the casters need Mana and the chance to get out their pet, the Ranger needs a wide open area where no pixel of the mob is stuck in some environment and free sight - AND cannot maintain it because TS wears off pretty fast.<br/>\n\"<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n- BL 65% slow is a VERY rare level 65 spell. With worse resist checks than a shaman. Beastlords are still useful before 65, and before having that spell. At this point, not a single BL on our server thats 60+ has the 65% slow spell. Yet, they seem to get groups just fine. <br/>\n<br/>\n- Druids can do far more than being MH. Their DS is quite useful, as a 38-point DS will add approximately 16 DPS to the group, onto the main tank on a 75% slowed mob (calculated that a 19-point DS adds about 8 DPS). They can still Evac. They can still snare effectively from castable items they have (which they have moreof than clerics)<br/>\n<br/>\n- Rangers don\'t need that much room; and AM-3/EQ with a good arrow will still significantly outdamage a rogue without TS. A mages highest level pet parses out the melee damage of slightly below a knight, more with max burnout. Plus their nukes. Your assumption that all rogues have to do is find the back of a mob and hack away. They have to carefully maintain agro, because shooting rangers will draw less agro, and so will mage pets. <br/>\n<br/>\nQuote:<br/>\n\"See? That was one of my points, Cleric for healer, most efficient, one of 3 possible tanks, here the one without need for mana regen WHILE only little mana regen is in place, then a lot DPS, typical for PoP. PoP not everywhere needs crowd control, but still, you could have upped your DPS a lot with a Enc instead of a BL, just from Haste and C4 or C5. 3 DPS dealers with an Enc are better than 4 DPS dealers with no Enc in my eyes, and with a Hybrid tank you NEED the Enc even more, or you have downtime every few pulls.\"<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nNow you\'re just going off track. THe warrior is in that group, not becuase he is the most efficient tank, but because I AM a warrior. Like I mentioned, that was the most efficient group I was in, and a group with 2 tanks ins\'t more efficient. NOt every group needs a chanter, and I disagree that a group of 3 damage dealers and a chanter is better than a group of 4 damage dealers, especially considering BL\'s can haste up to around the cap if melees have 36% haste or more. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn that particular group scenario, I have a cleric in there because I, as a warrior, provide no healing. None. Place a paladin into that group and you can sub out the cleric with a druid and achieve more efficiency. <br/>\n<br/>\nQuote:<br/>\n\"That comes from the view of a Warrior clearly, as for Knights, the battle does not establish agro, you have nearly no other choice than hoping for mana connecting attacks with hopefully as many procs as possible after a successfull taunt to build up a agro surplus to the group. A Knight establishes agro and maintains it with spells, some Paladins do the job with only 2 stuns, yes, but then they move on a very slim line to lose it. Personally I cast 4 to 5 Stuns per battle, and a few more FoA stuns if Heals / Slow seem to land late. DW Bracer? forget it, it is quite hard to channel that long cast time through even slowed PoP beating.\"<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nActually, 2-handers maintain agro VERY well due to a significant damage output per hit. you can\'t use DW bracer during a fight yea, but you can use it to establish initial agro. If the lone remaining tool paladins use for maintaining agro is their weapon and spells, then this is just wrong on your part. Disarm draws agro. Taunt still draws significant agro. And, 2-handers maintain agro quite efficiently. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you don\'t believe me, observe an AoW fight, or even a burrower fight. Warriors have to wield 2-handers because of the riposte effect. They have to maintain agro off an entire raid; including chealers, rogues, and nukers, and they do it quite often if others know what they\'re doing. This is by using 2-handers, some even so simple as a Primal 2-hander, which has shitty ratio and no proc. that 45/44 primal is EASILY replaceable by a paladin/SK through 2-handers out of ssra/VT/PoP.<br/>\n<br/>\nQuote:<br/>\n\"In the age of EB weapons that is not the case anymore, I\'ve seen and been told. Nevertheless, why do you think I asked for a small Warrior taunt upgrade?\"<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBullshit. I use and EB weapon. Other classes STILL have to constantly watch their agro. <br/>\n<br/>\nQuote:<br/>\n\"That is contradictive, you say that we don\'t get groups because of our spells, then you say we do. Let me tell you again, we do NOT get groups because of our spells (heals, buffs, rezzes in this context, Stuns are more our taunt). This shall be no flame, but I rather think that you seem to be ignoring the fact that groups need a tank if they choose between War/Pal/SK. They will look at the spells if a Cleric is missing, if they need a weak mob tanked, whatever\"<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nNot, you are misreading what I said. There is no contradiction in my words. I said hybrids don\'t get groups purely based on their spells, but that they are more appealing to a group than a warrior because they CAN cast spells. Try to understand the difference. Paladins are asked to group for their tanking ability. THeir spells serve to make them more attractive than warriors. They do not get in based solely on their spells, those just make getting in easier than for a warrior.<br/>\n<br/>\nQuote:<br/>\n\"And that EXACTLY is the sickness of this game, the basic misbalance. For everything one class can do, a group could go better with the \"King class\", versatility means jack, it is only good to counter lack of skills.<br/>\nThe game supports to few roles far too much: DPS, tanking, healing, crowdcontrol and lowering of relative mob-DPS by buffs and slow. Any class that is not king (or 80% within range of the king) gets not chosen for the spot if needed. Look at Druids: they heal 60% as good as Clerics and their DPS isn\'t that loved neither. They are chosen if the group doupts in their skills, for backup heals and evac, a bit DPS if the other stuff is not needed. They are still not chosen for any of the spots in the regular xp game if the kings are in range.<br/>\nEnchanters still are holy kings on their spot, Clerics are as well though they have some competition on the horizon already, ONLY Warriors are the specialists that have to already compete for their spot in a equal game. If it were for all those specialists as it is for Warriors now, it would be fair and balanced. Of course, the specialists need something in exchange for that, and no, Warriors haven\'t gotten it yet - THAT is what this thread is all about: To determine what Warriors should get to what degree while looking at all 3 tanks. That is what I want to support you with.<br/>\nOh, and no, as you see in the tank area, there wouldn\'t exist 3 times the same class.\"<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nDon\'t cut out 1 sentence from my paragraph and post it; that is VERY out of context. Contradict that whole paragraph if you\'re gonna, not one sentence. You failed to contradict my supporting statement, that in every other category, despite the fact that a \"king\" class exists, non-specialist classes still get groups just fine. \"Versatility does not mean jack\", don\'t pull menial @#%$ like that. Bards and necros are quite beneficial classes to a group BECAUSE of their versatility. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn your vision, everyone does everything the same. If your thought process is so narrowminded, \"why have unique 14 classes in the first place? Why not just remove every other class that\'s not part of the \"ideal\" group from the game. Then everyone can play an \"ideal\" class and live in peace, because then everyone is equal, no one is better than anyone else, and everyone is happy. Bullshit. Versatility between classes is the POINT behind having numerous classes. There will ALWAYS be a class that does something better than everyone else, and in turn is worse than their competitors in other areas. <br/>\n<br/>\nEnchanters aren\'t king on their spot. Many groups don\'t need mez. In those cases, chanters compete with shamans, and beastlords, whith shamans and beastlords providing quite a bit of features that are better than what a chanter can provide. In the field of mezzing, chanters are king only if they are the mezzer and slower for a group. If a shaman is already in the group, chanters would have to compete with bards and necros for that spot, and necros and bards would be FAR more useful in the strict messing role because they provide more versatility and other attributes to a group. <br/>\n<br/>\nYour perception of druids is also quite fallacious. In PoP, druids can get group spots as main-healer. Just yesterday, I was doing a PoS named for the BoT quest, with only a druid healing. Keep in mind, this is a triple-flurry mob with max hit around 1000, with easily 3x the HP of normal mobs in PoP. This is FAR harder than regular XP mobs in PoP. And yet, we survived, solely through druid healing. If a druid can keep me up through that kind of mob, you mean to tell me they can\'t act as healers in XP groups; because let me be the first to call BS on that, yet again. <br/>\n<br/>\nQuote:<br/>\n\"Then you would have a pre-melee balance tank spot again, When should a group take a Knight? Only if there is no Warrior available on the whole wide server? Well, thanks, go home! Take either-or, or make it situational like I wrote above. You don\'t want to balance your class with Balance in mind, but with becoming godclass in mind.\"<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nNot really. I won\'t go into details; they would do no good against your strict anti-versatility campaign. So, I\'ll leave it brief, knights would be chosen when tanking is not the only thing needed for a group. They would be chosen when their spell-casting and versatility can provide something that warriors could not, and this happends quite oftenly.<br/>\n<br/>\nQuote:<br/>\n\"And for Rogues then too? And for offensive casters that are balanced against current melee DPS too? How do you want to prevent them to solo all non-boss PoP content then even more?\"<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nNope, not for rogue. Just for those 3. There is quite a major gap as is between monk/ranger (non-archery)/warrior and damage classes.<br/>\n<br/>\nQuote:<br/>\n\"While I do not consider Druid/Shaman and Cleric healing balanced yet, I agree with you: Warriors should have - with comparable or even equal gear - 20% more HP than Knights, but then they also should have that taunt problem throughout the game, i.e. take out EB weapons. Think about a Warrior with EB weapons (able to hold agro quite well) with 20% more HP. Should your guild\'s Knights quit the game once the Warriors have their EB or what? Stop asking for the godmode!\"<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSee, now I can tell you know DICK about warriors. I DON\'T WANT 20% MORE HP THAN PALADINS. I DON\'T WANT THE TAUNT ABILITY OF A HYBRID. I DON\'T WANT GODMORE: READ MY @#%$ POST CAREFULLY. EB weapons do NOT provide all-mighty taunt ability. Bet you didn\'t know that an EB proc isn\'t always enough to outtaunt other classes. I\'ve had scenarios where I\'m chain-proccing my Blade of Carnage, and the mob doesn\'t even think about removing their dick from the chanters ass. I want 10-15 more MELEE damage mitigation for warriors, because damage soaking is ALL WE DO. In turn, I beg that disc defensive be stricken from the record. the 10-15% will be far more damage than we can take with defensive on, but at least we won\'t be relying of bandaid 3-year old discs to differentiate ourselves on the premise of defense, which is our sole purpose. And don\'t mistake damage mitigation for HP as you so eloquently elect to. Melee mitigation does nothing against AoE or spells. Therefore, I don\'t ask for 10-15% more HP, because that wouldn\'t be balanced, but simply 10-15% more mitigation.<br/>\n<br/>\nQuote:<br/>\n\"The current state of EQ tanking IS balanced, regardless of whether Warriors think it is or not. Warriors need a few tweaks, that\'s what this thread is about, but tanking itself as core supported ability in EQ (a game with THREE supposed tank classes) was never more balanced. Remember the time when YOU, just entering Sebilis or whatever, have been chosen over Knights that were LFG for hours! THAT was unbalanced, and that is what you want to get back to if reading your sentences.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry for getting pissy now, but me being called ignorant from people that seem to want to be that good that they have a higher chance for groups than me again is more than I can bear. Knights cannot solo well enough, lets say their solo benefits are below Warriors raid benefits, anyways, we get our XP in groups and groups only, the superduper highend game may enable us to solo some light blues, but wow, why should I if using the time to form a group is such much better spent. Therefor we deserve the same chance for groups, the core skill we offer is tanking, thus we need to be equal to Warriors in it. Honestly, you guys should ask for something reasonable, not a godmode again!\"<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nNo, the tanking issue isn\'t balanced due to the claims of a paladin, who clearly knows little to nothing about warriors, but makes assumptions at will about the benefit of our abilities. <br/>\n<br/>\nUnderstand something, NO ONE is asking for a return to the RoK days. If you wanna play the @#%$ past card, so will I. REmember the days of pre-ROK, where warriors had NOTHING over hybrids, and were little more than a @#%$ ranger without spell-casting that had no utility outside of tanking Naggy/Vox/Innoruk/Cazic? <br/>\n<br/>\nIf anyone wanted a return to RoK days, our demands would be along the lines of 50% more damage output, 20% more damage output, 15% more HP, and a nerf on paladin healing and casting ability. This isn\'t what anyone wants. Don\'t dramatize our theories, there is a middle ground, a balance point between RoK-status and what exists now. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat the @#%$ is this comparison between warrior raid utility and knight soloability. Raids REQUIRE 1-2 warriors tops for the most part for tanking. Raids also require paladin for AoE healing, and perhaps SK\'s for pulling. Don\'t feed me this \"raid utility\" bullshit. Shadowknight can also solo quite effectively, so don\'t balance out two unrelated extremes, especially with these bogus theories.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou are being called ignorant because you clearly understand very little about warriors, but come here repeating \"Tanking is balanced, we deserve same group chances\" over and over like a tape-recorder. YOu make assumptions about what our equipment gives, how much HP we have, and about the warrior class in general. So, I\'ll just say this again, Tanking should not be balanced because warriors cannot enough to a group to counteract the versatility and spell-casting of hybrids We\'re asking to balance a superior tanking ability versus your versatility, not for godmode.<br/>\nWilhelmm D\'averam<br/>\nWarlord of the Apocalypse<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWilhelmm\'s Profile</t>','3eac2f3eb02de46268e77387faa588ca',0,'','1cm80q0k',1,0,'',0,0,0,1,0,'',0),(891,210,37,51,0,'68.61.123.121',1506530918,0,1,1,1,1,'','Re: 9th dwarf ring quest npc','<t>Re: 9th dwarf ring quest npc	  #4	[-]<br/>\n avatar<br/>\n<br/>\nPosts: 0<br/>\nApr 4 03 4:03 AM<br/>\nReply Quote More<br/>\nMy Recent Posts<br/>\nSave yourself the time really, just tag along for your server\'s next Tormax raid or two.

I\'m not claiming to be an expert on paladins. When I say that it\'s easy to hold agro with 2-handers while using the taunt skill and disarm to maintain agro, I base this on warrior premise. However, since the agro-maintenance ability on 2-handers carries over irregardless of class, I make that statement.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, correct me if I\'m wrong here, but do paladins not have a disarm skill and a taunt skill? Do these skills not have somewhat decent caps? Can these skills be used to help in gaining agro? The answer to all 3 questions should be yes. <br/>\n<br/>\nI mentioned the usage of DW bracer as stun for initial agro. Yes, this is an assumption; I assume that you can put on a bracer and cast it on a mob without mana to get some kind of agro; because spells get agro irregardless if successful or not. <br/>\n<br/>\nThen, I asked a question; how many stuns or spells does it take to maintain agro, considering the most difficult moment is establishing agro over a mezzing chanter or healing cleric (Establishing vs. Maintaining is something you can learn without playing a paladin, becuase this is the law learned through playing a warrior.) I didn\'t say paladin spells earn this much agro, or that much agro.<br/>\n<br/>\nCan you please pin-point the exact spot where I make general assumptions about paladins, outside of the fact tha they are 90% warriors, which comes, by admission, from your fellow paladins posting here?<br/>\n<br/>\nFraust: you are correct. Paladins aren\'t required. HOwever, warrior(s) are not required either. 1 or 2 are, sometimes more depending on mob, but usually you don\'t need that many. Paladin\'s aren\'t required, but they are quite beneficial. A paladin is a far more beneficial asset than a non-tanking warrior. So, you can say that, while warriors have a required spot on a raid, a paladin is much more useful on a raid than a non-tanking warrior.<br/>\nWilhelmm D\'averam<br/>\nWarlord of the Apocalypse<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWilhelmm\'s Profile</t>','4c8684d3eca9b16ea69787a67b0b75cb',0,'','3fy4wvyt',1,0,'',0,0,0,1,0,'',0),(906,195,3,52,0,'198.86.16.250',1506531202,0,1,1,1,1,'','Re: Dear developer team: One knight\'s view of Warriors.','<t>I like the guy who stated the game should be balanced based on the highest end guild/players.

This means we are not secondary healers.\"<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHealing: keep in mind, paladins are the only class outside of clerics with any sort of group heal. Therefore, in a scenario like a raid, an AoE mob, or somewhere where everyone in the group is taking damage, their heal is still quite valuable, despite the fact that it doesn\'t heal a tremendous amount of HP. A paladin\'s backup healing power serves a different purpose, at least from the spell descriptions I\'m reading. For example: Light of Nife heals for 850 with a 400 mana cost before any focus effects; not very efficient. However, it\'s a 1-second cast time. And 850 HP can mean the difference between a cheal landing on-time, or just missing. <br/>\n<br/>\nI can\'t site how many times I\'ve died on a cheal landing half a second late. Backup healing roles, in my opinion, does not necessarily mean that the class must be able to heal a large amount of HP. In my opinion, backup healing is just that; an SoS heal that allows the primary healer to land his @#%$. Furthermore, while your spells may not heal for sensational amounts on yourself, healing another class, such as a chanter, or caster is quite different. Numerous chanters I group with still have below 4khp buffed. Even a 1k heal will still restore a significant amount of HP for them.<br/>\n<br/>\nQuote:<br/>\n\"In the end we are Tanks. We get groups not for our Damage output or heals or buffs or anything. We get groups because we are Tanks. Now are Paladins more beneficial than a Non-Tanking Warrior? While we are more versatile you do more damage but in the end we are both Tanks and that is what we do best. We just do it differently.\"<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease, reread my two posts. I\'ve already gone over this TWICE. let me quote the exact part of my post that deals with this:<br/>\n<br/>\nQuote:<br/>\n\"Not, you are misreading what I said. There is no contradiction in my words. I said hybrids don\'t get groups purely based on their spells, but that they are more appealing to a group than a warrior because they CAN cast spells. Try to understand the difference. Paladins are asked to group for their tanking ability. THeir spells serve to make them more attractive than warriors. They do not get in based solely on their spells, those just make getting in easier than for a warrior.\"<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSpells are a commodity. A very large commodity in my opinion. They are not the primary reason for selecting a paladin, but they are useful nonetheless. This entire post, from the very beginning, has been abotu what you mentioned yourself. The additional damage output (10%) and additional HP (700ish; 10%) and MAYBE slightly better defense (only through avoidance skill caps, there is NO other difference between damage absorbtion of warriors and hybrids), there is nothing else separating a warrior from paladins. THe problem is; these differences do not make up for the versatility and spell-casting hybrids can provide. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is what the crux of our argument has been this entire time. Warriors are a specialist class; a defensive specialist. Any other specialist class has a significant advantage over competing classes in filling their respective roles in a group. HOwever, their competitors provide versatility, and other useful aspects not presented by the specialist class. This exists in every field except tanking. Hybrids provide versatility, but warriors do not hold a significant advantage in fulfilling the tank role to counteract this. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nraising the soft cap is not an issue in my opinion, as it has already been increased. This, unfortunately, presents Disc timers maybe a good idea as well. Personally, I think the defensive (mainly) boost through innate increased damge mitigation and removal of /disc defensive, and/or offensive melee boosts to monk/ranger/warrior (not nearly as important, defensive boosts would be much better) would be a better solution.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWilhelmm D\'averam<br/>\nWarlord of the Apocalypse<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWilhelmm\'s Profile</t>','4393dd7d14d20218852edabc1f271b66',0,'','3d86t7od',1,0,'',0,0,0,1,0,'',0),(910,195,3,52,0,'198.86.16.250',1506531239,0,1,1,1,1,'','Re: Dear developer team: One knight\'s view of Warriors.','<t>Good to see your post here.

Those seem to be fairly easy to get and IMO are more useful than the warrior epic. Druid epic is fairly easy too and may be of consideration.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you are stuck on wanting the warrior epic, you will need to make friends with a lot of people. Then you will probably need to help them on a lot of epic fights as well. People tend to remember those that helped them on their epic fights and are more willing to help you then. That is the best way if you are not in a guild who focuses on epics. And for the time invested, the warrior epic has little payback for a guild that can get it. For the average guild, the force required for POS could probably do the mechanical dragon in POI. This can yield a taunting blow weapon with superior ratio to epic, 41% haste neck item, caster items, etc. Good items for a whole guild. Plus it flags you for the factory in POI.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would also recommend highly making a tracker to park in EJ to watch for Sev or a toon that can sense summoned. Sev\'s pet is summoned and can be sensed by a low lvl toon of the correct class (necro?) Unfortunately though, on Tunare at least, he rarely lives more than 30 minutes after spawning so you need a bunch of people ready to go at a moments notice.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother tactic you could try is to find several warriors in the same boat as you. Then I would have you and each of them find some clerics, enchanters, PORTERS (key for fast mobilization), and damage classes that are interested in the spells and loot table from Sev. (same goes for Talendor for red scale) After this is accomplished, I would get peeps in a chat channel and explain some ground rules. You will camp (ie drop exp groups etc when notified of the spawn) Sev/Tal until all the warriors have their scales. All other loot is randomed amongst the other attending members. Some nice spells and possibly haste items drop from Sev and Tal. I would make it clear that the warriors will NOT random on any droppable/no drop loot other than the scales which are warrior only or another class that can use like a bard for red scale. People tend to get ticked if they are helping a person with an epic drop and that person wants the non epic loot as well. Keep track of the spawn times of Sev/Tal and when they were last killed and have a tracker in zone covering the spawns. Advertise amongst your group when the \"expected\" spawn time will be and make sure people are in a channel around that time if they are on. Fast mobilization is the key or you will not get the mobs.<br/>\n<br/>\nInstead of using the droppable loot from the dragons you could form an alliance so to speak with people of multiple classes wanting their epic and get help and give help that way. The same methods could be used from above like the channel, tracking spawn times, etc. just it would encompass more than Sev/Tal. Then you all could form a semi permant channel that all log into when they play.<br/>\n<br/>\nDon\'t take my post the wrong way. I just completed my epic last Saturday at lvl 63 and am glad I did. But, if I hadn\'t had everything but the Queen Blade and already done turn ins, I probably would have sold the Green scale and bought some weapons that were every bit as good as the epic, like a Great Staff of Thunder 31/30 2hb, procs Planar Stun. These go for about 40k on Tunare and the scale is close to 100K I think. For a green scale and selling the MQ of the other parts you could probably get the staff, Windblade, Fleshgrinder and Frostbringer. Plus, when you upgrade them you could sell off the ones you don\'t need.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck on obtaining your epic and don\'t get in a rush. It will just frustrate you and this is a game after all and should be fun <E>:)</E> <br/>\n<br/>\nFriedrick - 63rd Warlord on Tunare Server<br/>\n&lt;a target=\"new\" href=\"<URL url=\"http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=365390%22%3EFriedrick%27s\"><LINK_TEXT text=\"http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.h ... riedrick\'s\">http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=365390\"&gt;Friedrick\'s</LINK_TEXT></URL> Magelo Profile&lt;/a&gt;</r>','d45fd77251d8aaa667f0b8074dc0fdea',0,'','3924n243',1,0,'',0,0,0,1,0,'',0),(923,214,37,51,0,'68.61.123.121',1506543041,0,1,1,1,1,'','Re: Never Gonna get my Epic','<t>Re: Never Gonna get my Epic	  #3	[-]<br/>\n avatar<br/>\n<br/>\nPosts: 0<br/>\nApr 7 03 3:41 PM<br/>\nReply Quote More<br/>\nMy Recent Posts<br/>\nGet a ranger and go camping in EJ on patch days.

Well eventually we started doing things like Hate raids, and inviting some friends we had made and that lead to a 5 guild alliance.

The starting stats on your barb are probably better than the stats that I have, with me doing it \"correctly\" by putting all my points in stamina. If it\'s a diety thing and you picked agnostic I can\'t blame you there as this gnome is my re-roll of a 51 agnostic troll. You\'d save yourself a lot of time and effort in just twinking out your existing barb. I must admit that it was fun throwing a bunch of twinked out gear on a 5th level gnome warrior. I only have small blocks of time to play (like an hour or so a day) so starting over was easy for me because I wasn\'t playing my 51 warrior anyway because it was too hard to find a group in that time.

I\'m a 51 agnostic dwarf warrior, my first EQ character, and I didn\'t make the best stat decisions when creating this one. I ended up putting most of my skills into STR and a couple into STA. Taking Mightie Gnome\'s magelo profile as an example, I determined that my STA is 35 pts higher than his is, yet he has about 400 more HP than me. So where is it coming from? Obvious answer is his equipment, most of the stuff he has on has plus HP on it, thats where the real HPs come from in the long run, not STA.

Also chose agnostic. Personally, I have found neither to be a huge problem holding me back. Part of it may be that I was in a small non-raiding guild until just before PoP came out, and I was the only one that stayed in the guild that had been a benefactor of a short lived alliance we had been in. Thus, I was in full thurg while the guild\'s other warriors were still in crafted or worse, even up to lvl 60, and all we could do was druid epics and the occasional hate or Kael run. (I got real good at tanking Uulump and Faydedar) Then, when I joined a guild that actually killed some decent mobs, because I had the equipment already I was able to get into the MT rotation, and therefore get upgrades, and we all know the cycle there. <br/>\n<br/>\nNow, my Iksar warrior alt (long story...don\'t ask) has what I would call a serious design flaw. When I made him, I was still stupid about stats....he was created as a Kunark mule, and I made him at a time when I was upset that I didn\'t put any points into str when I made my first warrior and therefore had to go sell all the time cause I was encumbered all the time. So, the Iksar got all of his points put into str. You see where this is going, I am sure....Iksar warrior with base Iksar sta (80) = bad. Keeping him above 100 sta has been difficult. The low HP hadn\'t been a problem up until now, because he was hugely twinked, as was all the chars in the group I play him in. But now, as he is approaching lvl 50, he is beginning to grow into his twinked equipment, and the low hp is starting to take its toll, especially added to the fact that his resists suck. Plus there is the problem of his iksarness....which means that I need to get him thurg to upgrade again decently. At least my guild is starting NToV while trying to keep at least non KOS to CoV....that means a LOT of faction killing in Kael. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, it\'s really up to you. Stats can be a problem, but only if they are drastically awful. None of the main starting stats for barbarians are as awful as some of the other races are, so you should be fine. Plus, the added dex is nice for more crits, which I have seen gives me more aggro, and more procs, which is always good on aggro. As for playing from scratch....it can be fun and not all work.

When Luclin came out I thought you would AA exp in a way that would be similar to that in Baldur\'s Gate. You were a warrior that could do more damage, or be better avoiding/taking damage. I would like to see AA exp that you do and train points and essentially become a different type of warrior. Or any class.

They are quest based, pretty damn uber, but not necessarily long to get. I would like to see epic armor of like boots / gaunts easier then pants / bp. What i would REALLY like to see is mobs that can be killed with 18 lvl 60 players that drop very nice loot, but not so nice that ub3r ntov guild+ wouldn\'t bother with them...although we all know that won\'t matter. The 60 people mindlessy beating into a mob that doesn\'t even require a ch rotation or anything difficult is just plane old boring, only the large guilds can kill the mob just because they are large. IV / itraer virus are examples, those mobs are a joke, just take 15min to kill. More mobs like vindy with a tad less difficulty. I mean, how many mobs are vindy difficulty? like 10? How many are ub3r guild difficulty? All of ntov, west wing, yalinek, statue(easy though), aow, tormax, and thats velious alone. Basically of of luclin minus UP mobs require mass numbers to kill, and not strat, just numbers. Rhags are easy, but whats the chances of seeing them up wiht the guilds farming keys in ssra? not much of one <E>:P</E><br/>\n<br/>\nQuicker spawn times, lower drop rate would also be nice. The amount of loot dropped would equal the same as before because they would spawn a lot more, but this would give other guilds hte experience to kill them, as many eq players would like to do rather than see loot.<br/>\n<br/>\nKinadafz</r>','50b0c99654aa2b6141c1ff0b381652b0',0,'','14o7okx1',1,0,'',0,0,0,1,0,'',0),(975,220,37,51,0,'68.61.123.121',1506544635,0,1,1,1,1,'','Re: Planes of Power Quests','<t>Re: epic armor	  #13	[-]<br/>\n avatar<br/>\n<br/>\nPosts: 0<br/>\nAug 22 02 12:23 AM<br/>\nReply Quote More<br/>\nMy Recent Posts<br/>\nI have to disagree with yo here Kina.<br/>\nI think they did a very nice job by putting in a lot of mobs,quests doable by about 3 groups level 60.<br/>\nPretty much all UP mobs,Rhags 1 and 2,Servitor,ROS,Gnome maze quest,The Vah Dyn and prolly some more stuff I forgot.<br/>\nStuff I\'d like to see is an upgrade to our epic and the possibility to change your deity(Although I\'m very happy with the one I have now :b )<br/>\nOne quest I\'d like to see as well is one where you have to visit almost every zone in the game w/out being able to port/be ported.<br/>\n______________________________________________________________________<br/>\nCrayno Wolffang,Barbarian Warlord <br/>\nRing der Nibelungen</t>','d4938a1e8e0b1763de52943b27249458',0,'','8ygb10x5',1,0,'',0,0,0,1,0,'',0),(976,220,37,51,0,'68.61.123.121',1506544645,0,1,1,1,1,'','Re: Planes of Power Quests','<t>Re: epic armor	  #14	[-]<br/>\n avatar<br/>\n<br/>\nPosts: 0<br/>\nAug 22 02 10:07 AM<br/>\nReply Quote More<br/>\nMy Recent Posts<br/>\nYet how many are there for the ub3r guilds?

After all aren\'t there enough quests where you have to engage dozens of mobs at a time?<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe allow me to change my religion for doing a series of God specific pilgrimages. Agnostic means that I feel there *may* be a God out there but I haven\'t seen evidence of the God or had a compelling reason for me to worship him or her. I chose agnostic waaay back in the early years thinking that one day I\'d like to kill a god or two. I didn\'t know what gifts a god would bestow upon me for worshiping them. Let me be enlightened!! <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, how can someone worship Rallos Zek and then run up to Kael and kill the AoW or to PoP and then kill the God himself? Give a penalty for that!!! Strip them of thier religion or do what Naggy and Vox do. Soon as you get on your God\'s agro list, Poof! Out ya go! Yes, if you wanna kill all the Gods you\'ll have to end up agnostic...<br/>\n<br/>\nSpeaking of agnostic, make some items for agnostics! Hows about a sword with a Bane on religious factions!! Okay, maybe a little far fetched and useless outside of PoP. But why not? And why NOT agnostic armor?

If you\'re good or neutral and go KOS to your own diety, those diety specific items you own should all shatter and do damage to you if equiped. [Yes, I realise that is kinda harsh.]<br/>\n<br/>\nQuests that I would like to see be added:<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nQuest to change one\'s diety.<br/>\nThese quests shouldn\'t be difficult nor involve ultra rare drops, but they should be long and time consuming. I would say that you\'d have to start the quest by dealing with mortal agents of the diety, gain additional assistance from agents of allied dieties, make direct strikes against enemy dieties or a large number of their agents, and finally visit the diety in question. Naturally some limits would need to be put in place. You shouldn\'t be able to select a diety that wouldn\'t be appropriate to your class.<br/>\n<br/>\nQuest to change one\'s culture.<br/>\nBecause of cultral tradeskill benefits being added way late into the game, quests should be added that allows one to essentially be adopted into a culture other than their own. These quests should be rather time consuming, requiring the individual to prove their worthiness to various guilds throughout the city as well as follow one of the dieties who\'s presence can be felt in that city. Some diety, race and class combinations should make these quests easier to do, while others should have a harder time.<br/>\nFor example - Maesyn Trueshot in Kelethin is more likely to help me gain wood elf culture than a very friendly ogre that just walked in. While I\'m a half elf, I\'m still more elf than that ogre. I can also pull the fellow ranger and we both worship Tunare cards that the ogre can\'t. However, when I go over to the warrior guild, my class isn\'t going to help at all.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nUpdated Epic Weapons.<br/>\nQuests should all be equal in difficulty, with all haing worthwhile rewards. And the random drop off of a rare mob thing is annoying and should be done away with. Graphics should be worthwhile so that everyone is happy with what they get [i.e. no deadly duck staffs or flaming swords] and the end result should be something that is good and worthwhile. The two-hander to one-hander thing of the warrior epic, was cool and all classes should something like that but the result needs to be appropriate to the class and useful to them. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nNew Class Specific Armour Quest.<br/>\nI think it is time for a new armour set for each class. Luclin didn\'t really do anything in this area.<br/>\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nView Magelo Profile</t>','9038a7ada0430530f8834eb82d374ba6',0,'','3dsg671p',1,0,'',0,0,0,1,0,'',0),(980,220,37,51,0,'68.61.123.121',1506544839,0,1,1,1,1,'','Re: Planes of Power Quests','<t>Re: Planes of Power Quests	  #19	[-]<br/>\n avatar<br/>\n<br/>\nPosts: 0<br/>\nSep 8 02 5:03 AM<br/>\nReply Quote More<br/>\nMy Recent Posts<br/>\nI am ally to Rallos Zek faction as of right now Rallos Zek faction != Kael faction.

I just harmonied and pulled him away from the cleric, he\'s straight melee. He hits for ~150s max and has about 15khp. <br/>\n<br/>\nCleric came next. This sonofabitch likes to heal and gate. I used three low-level stun spells on the druid to keep him stunned so he couldn\'t CH or gate (I was pulling them to SG tunnel). <br/>\n<br/>\nNext, I harmony pulled the Shaman. His pet was annoying as it resisted every @#%$ spell I cast on it, whether it was an antisummoned spell, a root, moonfire, wildfire, whatever. Wound up meleeing it to death while the shaman himself walked towards the tunnel while snared. When the shaman arrived, he didn\'t cast a whole lot. Mostly DOTs. He didn\'t try to gate, and wasn\'t too difficult.<br/>\n<br/>\nWizard came last. I fought him where he spawned in case he would gate. If you can get MR/CR/FR above 150, he\'s cake. If not, keep him stunned. He casts Ice Comet at hardest, and uses a variety of nukes. He has relatively few HP compared to the rest. He wasn\'t too hard either.<br/>\n<br/>\nHardest to easiest:<br/>\nCleric<br/>\nShaman<br/>\nWizard<br/>\nWarrior<br/>\n<br/>\nWar and Dru is a good combo.<br/>\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;h6&gt;&lt;a href=\"<URL url=\"http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=102784\">http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=102784</URL>\" target=\"_blank\" style = \"text-decoration:none;\"&gt;<br/>\n&lt;font color=\"#33CCFF\"&gt;&lt;font size=+2&gt;Planetium Hollowood&lt;/a&gt;&lt;BR&gt;<br/>\n&lt;a href=<URL url=\"http://www.steelwarrior.org\">http://www.steelwarrior.org</URL> target=\"_blank\" style= \"text-decoration:none;\"&gt;&lt;font color=\"#33CCFF\"&gt;&lt;font size=+1&gt;Warrior&lt;/a&gt;<br/>\n&lt;font color=\"#33CCFF\"&gt;&lt;font size=+1&gt; of &lt;a href=<URL url=\"http://pub6.ezboard.com/bnamelesstavern\">http://pub6.ezboard.com/bnamelesstavern</URL> style = \"text-decoration:none;\"&gt;&lt;font color=\"#33CCFF\"&gt;&lt;font size=+1&gt;The Nameless&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;<br/>\n&lt;/p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;</r>','1f7fca9b16114db176f94c7cea360132',0,'','3re31g46',1,0,'',0,0,0,1,0,'',0),(1019,226,37,51,0,'68.61.123.121',1506545750,0,1,1,1,1,'','Re: Draconic Pauldrons','<t>Re: Draconic Pauldrons	  #11	[-]<br/>\n avatar<br/>\n<br/>\nPosts: 0<br/>\nMar 27 03 1:31 PM<br/>\nReply Quote More<br/>\nMy Recent Posts<br/>\nI think the barb is a beastlord and not a shaman.<br/>\n_______________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n<br/>\nGrobsmash 61 Warlord<br/>\nClick here to make me uber</t>','8412d9c3c252fafb304cb733fb078b6e',0,'','2lqk3kml',1,0,'',0,0,0,1,0,'',0),(1020,226,37,51,0,'68.61.123.121',1506545760,0,1,1,1,1,'','Re: Draconic Pauldrons','<t>Re: Draconic Pauldrons	  #12	[-]<br/>\n avatar<br/>\n<br/>\nPosts: 0<br/>\nMar 27 03 1:35 PM<br/>\nReply Quote More<br/>\nMy Recent Posts<br/>\nAny idea of the faction required to initate and turn in?</t>','ecd69ec1d76545243a93c12ddd88a69b',0,'','9vr381pc',1,0,'',0,0,0,1,0,'',0),(1021,226,37,51,0,'68.61.123.121',1506545774,0,1,1,1,1,'','Re: Draconic Pauldrons','<t>Re: Draconic Pauldrons	  #13	[-]<br/>\n avatar<br/>\n<br/>\nPosts: 0<br/>\nMar 28 03 4:18 AM<br/>\nReply Quote More<br/>\nMy Recent Posts<br/>\nI think I got the quest at highest kindly, got warmly just after the turn-in.<br/>\n--------------------------<br/>\nKaldayr, truc qui heal la retraite<br/>\nLamorr Otrouss et Khazthet Haklak, trucs qui tappent<br/>\nEaranorn, truc qui ... euh ... enfin truc quoi ...<br/>\nTout ce beau monde l\'Acadmie</t>','d8f7e2c370444f4c63b82170c3ffd6ec',0,'','1aq6fsap',1,0,'',0,0,0,1,0,'',0),(1022,226,37,51,0,'68.61.123.121',1506545784,0,1,1,1,1,'','Re: Draconic Pauldrons','<t>Re: Draconic Pauldrons	  #14	[-]<br/>\n avatar<br/>\n<br/>\nPosts: 0<br/>\nApr 2 03 2:49 PM<br/>\nReply Quote More<br/>\nMy Recent Posts<br/>\nDid this with a 60 bard and 56 cleric.

I\'m level 65 and my guild\'s main tank and have been pushing recently to start getting us keyed for ST. Our guild leader thinks it may be a bit soon but I\'m not so sure that it\'s too early to start thinking about it. I\'m wondering what the relative diffuculty of ST is compared to area\'s such as HoT which is where we are now. Would we pretty much need to progress through West and NToV first to get better geared up?<br/>\nOur raid mix is typicly 25-35 people with an avg level of 59-60 so I\'m, thinking by the time we got keyed, if we started now, we\'d be a few levels higher on average with somewhat better gear although no one in guild has anything along the lines of NToV or Ssra equipment.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nVeteran Prytty Heartsmiter<br/>\nOverlord of The Arisen and damn sexy troll<br/>\nTerris-Thule Server</t>','de81642b53063853f9086449ec34cc47',0,'','1nluj8cv',1,0,'',0,0,0,1,0,'',0),(1057,233,35,2,0,'50.25.122.79',1506551732,0,1,1,1,1,'','Re: Question about ST','<t>Move directly to Sleepers as fast as possible, and do not bother with NToV.</t>','e4ace63bdd34a934ed5cb204be6a4288',0,'','2n7uk01v',1,0,'',0,0,0,1,0,'',0),(1058,233,35,2,0,'50.25.122.79',1506551745,0,1,1,1,1,'','Re: Question about ST','<t>It depends on your intent in ST right now.

Avatar adds pretty good dps to your guild. MoTG cycles isn\'t hard once you learned it, we did it with 6 people on our first trip, wiped twice to learn it but after that it is cake walk. If you doubt your dps to take out these ST key mobs try with Zlandicar(slowable) and Klandicar they are both pretty easy. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe didn\'t do WToV, i think it was a waste of time, HoT gear is efficient enough. NToV isn\'t much harder either, aim for ST key for now until you get a few primals then move into NToV for more farming. NToV is where we are at now, and i can tell you once you defeat Aaryonar everything else in NToV is smooth sailing. Kinda disapointed how easy NToV was after hearing horror stories about it\'s difficulty.. i guess the extra 5 lvls helped alot.<br/>\n<br/>\nAdded: The Progenitor is a little harder than MoTG but not by much, we have done it with under 2 groups only with 1 cleric, 1 druid, 1 sham, and 1 bard.

Although the non KOS mobs can be 60+, you have no way to tell unless you got a level 60 character, or if you\'ve some 3rd party device that\'d tell you what level they are. You lose a lot of XP for fighting something not within 5 levels (or I guess you can view it as you gain a lot of XP for fighting within 5 levels). Assuming you\'re level 65, you want to fight level 60+ mobs, but there\'s no way to tell by con. Only frogs and giants are consistently 60+, though if you don\'t care about trashing factions, just about everything on Askr the Lost\'s faction is 60+ (no idea how hard those mobs are, though).<br/>\n<br/>\nFrogs are probably easiest but they take forever to respawn once cleared. Forest giants are probably the best especially for a warrior since Manabolt has no effect on warriors whatsoever, and Shaman giants are basically free kills since they waste a lot of time Maloing everyone (though once in a while they will cast nasty spells). Ocean giants can be tough for a low end group to handle because Shock of Magic can kill pullers with low resists easily. Desert giants are by far the hardest and really not worth the time fighting.<br/>\nPhantron</t>','bfe7e1591325a4b9f8a43a0f77a89986',0,'','bmu75pg9',1,0,'',0,0,0,1,0,'',0),(1108,239,35,2,0,'50.25.122.79',1506552957,0,1,1,1,1,'','Re: Can a group exp grind in PoS?','<t>i double box a 64 war and a 61 shammy at the lake, it\'d be really safe exp if he had malo, i only have trouble when the debuffs are resisted a few times.

Nothing like having giants from the floors bellow warp on ya. Not sure if this was fixed, but I dont trust veran, so we keep fighting outside walls. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs for loot in BoT....I jsut dont know what the hell is up with verant. What is the damn point of clearing a tower of giants, to get to a tower boss and the bastard only droping a spectral and a container for a damn key.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is not always the case though. But the Boss that supposedly drops BPs for silk classes has NEVER droped anything. It only droped 1 rune out of 5 kills. <br/>\nThats it. The rest had been tegi scales, spectrals(and it only drops one per kill) and ring container.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe boss that drops BP molds and Blade of Storms has been nicer to us. Out of 4 kills he droped first BP mold, Blade of storms and a rune. The second time a BP mold and a rune. The third time just a rune and the fourth time he droped nothing but a spectral. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe wind boss on first kill droped only a spectral, on second kill he droped the Staff of Four winds. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe have yet to kill the Earth boss to see what he drops. He has a 17/24 dagger with 100hp + 15% backstab modifier that all our rogues want, but its probably a rare drop. <br/>\n<br/>\nI hope verant does fix the drop rates of these Tower bosses at least. Too much of a task to clear them and kill the boss for just a chance to drop something good or nothing at all. (sorry but spectrals are NOTHING for all the risk and time invested)<br/>\n<br/>\nGetting flagged for BoT is a task on its own. I was expecting something more rewarding in BoT. At least they could have made BPs to always drop from bosses. Weapons being uncommon. The rest of the giants in the towers should have the rare chance of droping any ornate piece outside BP. Kinda like ToV.

If nothing else it is so much easier to make a few small tweaks at the end game then it is to base the whole game on end game content<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe point is you can\'t really balance the game at a NtoV level. The players playing that level are spread all over the place, some are as low as lvl 55 some as high as 65. Some have 0 AA, some have 50+ AA. The closest you can get to a uniform grouping of player gear/ability is towards the top end. So while they need to consider balance at all points in the game, the only time they can really judge balance is at the end game IMO. IF all else fails they have to balance things assuming you have full AA, full spells and access to all gear, because thats one point in the game where everyone is on a level playing field.<br/>\nFraustkilicus, Halfling Paladin</t>','b38af54660e9416982c4277b4927c3a6',0,'','14t3gz91',1,0,'',0,0,0,1,0,'',0),(1166,195,3,52,0,'198.86.16.250',1506690319,0,1,1,1,1,'','Re: Dear developer team: One knight\'s view of Warriors.','<t>Well, this thread moved on a long way since I posted last, so, and because it seems to lead to no good, I will refrain from using large quotations again.<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst off, sorry, if it seemed that my replies were aimed at only one poster, they used quotes of one, but aimed at the various wishes of many posters here.<br/>\n<br/>\nSomeone said that Paladins aren\'t necessarily needed on raids, but contribute something fine when there (that is the raidrole I talked about earlier, we usually don\'t tank on raids, maybe offtank if not enough Warriors are there). And that Warriors aren\'t needed neither, except for maybe two, but don\'t contribute enough aside from a bit DPS when not MT.<br/>\nExactly that point was why I asked for that raidimprovements via AA in DPS and Avoidance/Mitigation.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt also was told about how good 2H/Taunt/Disarm hold agro by itself and that Knights being stronger Agro catchers would be a flaw in balance. While the 1st part may be true (may be, as it is the situation I am in when I am oom and couldn\'t build initial agro - it plain sucks somehow), the second is not a flaw: Knights have always been considered to be taunting and getting agro faster than Warriors.<br/>\nWarriors did not grow in the same manor as the rest of the classes in improvements, and the improvements of other classes often leaded to more agro production. This is what VI has to repair, especially before the \"EB stage\" of the game. That was another point I asked for.<br/>\nHP/AC leadership (as some but not all actually asked for), i.e. the lack of it, derived from the wish of VI to not have Highend gear rot by making it nearly all/all. In my stage of the game I see lower level Warriors with clearly worse gear get equal or more HP/AC than I have - that is what makes me believe that this low gap only appears in the Highend game. Anyways, Warriors deserve to have an advantage of 20% in that area, be it by gear, AA or formulas. If I didn\'t include that into my opinion I do it now, officially.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAll that though has to be done quite carefully though and that is what I wanted to create sensibility for. As in my initial post I still see the dire need for improvements for Warriors from 55 on, beginning with a slight better Taunt in the \"normal\" game, ranging over a better raid role, and ending in the missing HP/AC, or even Avoid/Mitig advantage in the endgame.<br/>\nAll that has to be handled very carefully, I say it again, as it mustn\'t exceed the utility of Knights in the xp game throughout the stages. It needs to be measured exactly how efficient a group is with a Knight vs. with a Warrior. The Knights need to be able to tank xp mobs in their tier of the game as good as Warriors - meaning all three using all their options, and their group\'s assistance. For a healer the situation would look like this: A knight draws all need for heals on himself (no spread heals) while the Warrior produces a need for a few spread heals while himself not needing as many heals.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis really has to be achieved for Warriors and Knights, and the further game (gear, zones, mobs) mustn\'t be designed around Warriors tanking only as it was in former expensions often times. Raid encounters yes, but not xp zones.<br/>\nWell, I am not countering other people\'s ideas, if there are good ones, BRING them, and VI: REALIZE THEM, your customers DO have a clue...<br/>\n<br/>\nIf the topend Warriors see a 10% Mitigation/Avoidance upgrade more needed, and sufficient for balance, bring it! If that is the case though, I really feel to have the taunting untouched, as that will be Knights\' only advantage to Warrior taking tank spots then, we play a tank class, are chosen for being tanks by groups (even if we are oom), and pay the same fee per month, soloing is nerfed with PoP (never was really efficient anyways, at least for Paladins), this game is groupenforcing. If Taunt, HP/AC and Avoidance/Mitigation would be changed for Warriors, Knights would really need something to offset their disadvantage for groups as they are no DPS classes and tanking doesn\'t stack, they would need something while being very well rounded now (and not overpowered or anything)...<br/>\n<br/>\nFor all participants (incl myself), lets try to no more derail this threat to a Warrior vs. Knight topic, but keep it as a \"What do Warriors need with a few on the other tankclasses\" style.<br/>\n<br/>\nShay</t>','a5d9f10e0f7d8af07cab49a8de61717f',0,'','3vty1xy6',1,0,'',0,0,0,1,0,'',0),(1167,195,3,52,0,'198.86.16.250',1506690327,0,1,1,1,1,'','Re: Dear developer team: One knight\'s view of Warriors.','<t>\"IF all else fails they have to balance things assuming you have full AA, full spells and access to all gear, because thats one point in the game where everyone is on a level playing field\"<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst, all else hasn\'t failed.. they just didn\'t try anything else.<br/>\n<br/>\nSecond, how can you condone balancing 100% of the players on a level only 5-10% will ever see?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHow hard would it be to figure out the average level of players, the average number of aa\'s per player and go from there.

Having a Knight tanking prevents the mob to jump the shaman tho but I think that should remain one of the innate advantages of being a Knight), is some upgrades in both AA / disciplines sectors.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs I said before, VI should turn the most dumb and useless of the warrior specific AAs (warcry and rampage for example) into something actually useful, and tweak a bit some other ones (ambidextrity should add twice more dual wield swings that it actually does, flurry 3 should proc a bit more often). Then, I would either like to see discs on different timers, either at least have the timer on offensive discs reduced by 2 or 3 (agressive / mightystrike / fellstrike). I would also like VI to introduce an another source for the green dragon scale. Sounds maybe stupid to those of you who are in ubah guilds and have ubah stuff, but I just find that actually warrior\'s epic is way too hard to obtain for what it is worth (is it a part of class blance tho ? dunno, writing it \"on the fly\"). Some little solo specific upgrades would be cool too, but I dont see how it could be achieved without making warrior overpowered.

But they shouldn\'t be too large, like weapons of which two procs equal the hate given from one stun, attainable from Gorenaire tier mobs. <br/>\nOr changing the Taunt skill so that it adds level*2 hate if it fails and not places you on top of the hate list, would certainly help a bit.<br/>\nAll that comes from a viewpoint of playing my alts at the moment or being in a group with a EBless Warrior as Paladin. I do not necessarily want to tank then, but if the Warrior cannot hold agro, it is boring for others as they have to wait eternally to partake in the fight and dangerous as well, even more in PoP.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd yes, I am High Elf in full SS quest and epic, the Warriors I\'ve seen pass me in HP/AC are Wood Elfs as well though.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, in my eyes, the changes need to be either in basic game mechanincs or in AA, in AA though they are far easier to realize and to tweak and adjust to the needs of Warriors, thus faster introducable. And AA don\'t force players to be in a certain tier guild to get the enhancements, i.e. a Warrior in a Gorenaire level guild doesn\'t need to leave for a NToV or AoW/Emperor guild, a Warrior in a 10 member family style guild with players level 5 to 65 doesn\'t need to leave neither. If he plays the xp game, he can get the needed balance as well then.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, resuming the 8 pages so far:<br/>\n<br/>\n- Small taunt upgrades for Warriors, suggesting 1H weapons with agro procs giving 50 (Vox style), 125 (Gorenaire style), 250 (Vindicator style?) hate but bad DPS scaling with attainability and all tagged \"no drop\" with level requirements, maybe 55, 59 and 63.<br/>\n- Some few Warrior only 1H weapons with good DPS ratios but with maybe a taunt-curse on them (for when Warriors aren\'t MTs)<br/>\n- A PoP AA in 3 levels replacing discipline defensive that gives more HP, AC, Mitigation, Avoidance, 03% at 61, 05% at 63, 08% at 65.<br/>\n- Additions to the shield skill: a groupversion and an anti-spell version, stackable within the different /shields (i.e. normal /shield stacks with /groupshield and /spellshield, but not with another /shield) to give Warriors another raidutility for if they are not MTs<br/>\n- AA skill to slightely enhance the /shield skills<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, I know some asked for only the HP/AC/Av./Mi. upgrades at a higher value, but I don\'t consider them balanced at a degree of 20% or even pure 10%, if they come together with the first part taunt upgrades, which are really needed as I see it.<br/>\nAssuming (read: if it\'s true that) a Super top end Knight has 9000 HP while a Warrior has only 500 more (as some say it actually is the case), the 8% would bring the Warrior to 10750 HP, 1750 or 19% more than the Knight.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow if this all goes life, I\'d ask VI to only tune the actual agro procs of those weapons, i.e. if the combination gives Warriors a too high advantage, cut down the Hate procs each.

You may be healing 4k or so per ch, but your gonna be healing more often. Paladins, on average, lose hp\'s at a faster rate then a warrior.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is absolutely no rule that says warriors have to use 1hs. The majority of the warriors in my guild use 2hs for exp, and only use 1hs when mt\'ing in a raid where you have a bunch of people. I\'ve seen some new wpns in pop with enraging blow 2hd. The only way a warrior would feel forced to go 1hs is if he had enraging blow 1hder, otherwise, he\'s probably better off with 2hd anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\nTrue, but the more we are able to heal, the more we hurt our tanking/hp\'s. You can\'t have a large mana pool and maintain the highest AC/HP. Maybe you can post VT, but there are always trade offs. I have 3k+ mana.... and only 1190 ac and 3800 hp\'s unbuffed. Remember also, pop heals are mana hogs because they are fast casting, good for emergencies, but you don\'t use them unless you have to.<br/>\n<br/>\nTrue, but what happens when you have a bad pull, or get trained, or you get a named mob? Just because the paladin can lock agro does not mean he will be able to stand up long enough for a single healer to land a big heal. Warrior\'s can atleast go defensive if needed, and they tank better. A secondary healer is a very good thing if your paladin is tanking. If he ain\'t tanking he can act as a secondary healer usually, but still not a good idea because of the way we are designed.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the end though the need to fix taunt, perhaps make warrior taunt a set value. You hit the button you generate 200 hate. You hit the button you generate 200 more. Maybe cap it so that you can only use it 3-4 times in a row. Then it has no affect unless someone else jumps higher on the list. At that point you can hit it again for 3-4 more times. That might keep agro from being a garunteed thing, yet make taunt workable.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, just my thoughts on it. This is from the perspective of someone who is not in ntov.

It seriously is.<br/>\nReasons for my statement are :<br/>\n<br/>\n1. Everyone mentions EB weapons ( well, the last few pages ). Why should a Warrior need EB? Because their DPS sucks. To make matters worse; Warriors should not rely on a stupid 3 minute discipline ( Defensive ) which lowers their DPS even more to compensate for being hit.<br/>\n<br/>\n2. Disciplines in themselves are a f**king joke ( besides aggressive ). All disciplines should be on ( at the most ) a Fifteen minute refresh times..because, well, because any more than that is a slap in the face. Ask any warrior why they won\'t use any of the \'fun\' dsciplines ( aka offensive ones ) becuase \"What if we need me to go defensive and I just wasted a 55 minute disc?\". F**k that. VI wants me, a proud warrior; to be cubbyholed into being an ace in the hole with defensive instead of actually trying to contribute to the gorup dynamics because...well, I don\'t know. They need someone to laugh at? <br/>\n<br/>\n3. Taunt. Taunt this. Taunt that. Taunt me a f**king river because the stream has dried up. Taunt I feel is a stupid line of text that has no bearing whatsoever on WTF is happening. Taunt should show some kind of relevant effect or something. <br/>\n<br/>\nWarriors version of Taunt : Ramming your sword up some critters ass sideways until it comes out their nose.<br/>\nVI\'s version of Taunt : Sticking your thumb on your nose and wiggling your fingers going \" neener-neener\".<br/>\n<br/>\nWarriors are broken on so many levels that there really isn\'t one genuine solution to it all besides revamping the entire game and every other class around it. It\'s sad when the \"benchmark\" class towards all melee is left broken down on the side of the road 2 years ago.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd to add; before anyone goes and calls this a hate response; yes I was a warrior; I enjoyed the class somewhat with all of it\'s shortcomings. and ultimately at the end the reasons above added with the remarks made by most other classes about \"my roles\" and \"my shortcomings\" and \"lack of any contributions towards hunting besides my 3 minute miracle mob tanking on raids\" ended my career in the game. <br/>\n<br/>\nI just got tired of waiting for Absorific while I was hanging on to some dead dream of one day being fixed.

When the defensive skill is identical, and AC is roughly similar, there is no realistic way for there to be a substantive difference in the amount hit, making them \'lose hp at a faster rate\', aside from avoidance skill differences.<br/>\n<br/>\nLet\'s look at those (Ennder, I hope you\'re checking this out):<br/>\n<br/>\nSkill caps for avoidance differences:<br/>\n<br/>\nWarrior:<br/>\n<br/>\nDodge: 175<br/>\nParry: 230<br/>\nRiposte: 225<br/>\n<br/>\nPaladin:<br/>\n<br/>\nDodge: 150<br/>\nParry: 205<br/>\nRiposte: 200<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is a 12.5% difference in avoidance skills. The real question though is how does this pan out to tanking? What does this mean in the real world? The only real way to find this out is this: How many more times per 100 does a Paladin get hit vs. a warrior? There\'s a fairly easy way to mathematically find this out:<br/>\n<br/>\n1. Parse warrior avoidance, which I\'ve done.<br/>\n<br/>\nOver 346 fights, my averages were this (65 Warrior with CA3, agility 290):<br/>\n<br/>\nDodge: 2.68% of all blows<br/>\nParry: 3.7% of all blows<br/>\nRiposte: 3.57% of all blows<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you give the full 12.5% difference to a Paladin in similar tanking situations, it\'ll work out to this:<br/>\n<br/>\nPaladin (CA3, Agi 290)<br/>\n<br/>\nDodge: 2.34%<br/>\nParry: 3.24%<br/>\nRiposte: 3.12%<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat this means is in fighting, there is a difference of:<br/>\n<br/>\n0.335% difference due to warriors\' increased Dodge skill<br/>\n0.44% difference due to warrior\'s increased Parry skill<br/>\n0.45% due to warrior\'s increased riposte skill<br/>\n<br/>\nFor a grand total of 1.225% difference. <br/>\n<br/>\nI get hit 1.225 times less than you out of every 100 hits. This is NOT nearly as substantial as many people try to make it out to be, as a matter of fact, it\'s another point where we look at the skills and go \"wow, I\'m a better tank\", yet seriously, if you stun a mob once for every 400 hits, you compensate for it by preventing 4 seconds worth of attacks. You stun mobs for more than once every 400 hits. Most likely every 200 or so, seeing that a fight lasts roughly 188 hits in the planes.</t>','1e630d4261abe9bdd1e636204c6c0add',0,'','3pl8ey0k',1,0,'',0,0,0,1,0,'',0),(1185,195,3,52,0,'198.86.16.250',1506690575,0,1,1,1,1,'','Re: Dear developer team: One knight\'s view of Warriors.','<t>Note the part about needing wis/mana along with hp/ac.

There seems to be this grand assumption that there\'s these huge masses in the mid-level of the game who stay there. I simply don\'t see it. The way I see server populations you have the following:<br/>\n<br/>\n-Casual Players, those who will forever be casual players, they log on for an hour or two at a time and go solo something, or group with a couple of friends, and then take off, and come back a day, a couple days later. They really care very little about \"class balance\" issues, the only thing that they seem to be upset about is the inability to advance in a raiding environment in the time that they allot to the game. Balance cannot be made nor should it be based on casual players. Casual players make up a fairly sizeable chunk of the EQ population, but also are a very unreliable demographic group. While there seems to be a large number of casual players, the group is fluid and the individuals change. In other words, those who are \"casual\" tend to go in and out in terms of their account status, others come in and go, others come in and go, while the group \"casual players\" seems to remain a similar size.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Social Players, Those in \"friends\" guilds. They play for the \"chatroom with graphics\" and are just as happy roaming from Freeport to Qeynos and wiping out greenies as they are exping. There\'s a reasonable number of \"social gamers\", and they\'re loyal account holders based on their in-game social connections.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Bazaar Gamers, Those who spend a lot of time \"farming\" items for sale in the Bazaar, then playing the \"buy low, sell high\" game. They\'re loyal players, but tend to tailor their gaming experience toward the most efficient, that which makes their goals of \"the best in droppable equipment\" most attainable. <br/>\n<br/>\n- Time-limited hardcore gamers: This who have \"real lives\" but who also want to get the most out of their EQ experience. They tend to want the power increases that levels and equipment provide. They raid, perhaps not real often, but they do raid, and they continually look to increase their characters, but they cannot \"do it all\", and their RL obligations prevent them from advancing at a similar rate to true hardcore gamers. This is the demographic to which Chavr belongs, but unfortunately, it\'s a fairly small demographic. <br/>\n<br/>\n- Hardcore gamers: These are the people who are on for 4+ hours per day, exp grinding or raiding in heavy raid zones/guilds. They tend to be 60+, and raiders. <br/>\n<br/>\nNow, I\'m going to look at my server, 7th hammer, known serverwide as a fairly \"gimp\" server. The following guilds are capable of clearing NToV. (all these guilds are actually past the NToV stage, and most have moved onto AoW/Ssra level mobs)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Dark Exile<br/>\nDiligence<br/>\nForged Souls<br/>\nGood Guys<br/>\nFires Within<br/>\nNightwatcher<br/>\nUsque Sidera<br/>\nRing Der Niblugen<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThat\'s 8 guilds with about 100 members in each (except Ring, who has about 50ish members). Some more, some less. <br/>\n<br/>\n750 people out of a server population of 2000ish at any given time. There\'s at least 4 other guilds who are capable of doing NToV who may or may not have, but I stopped paying too much attention to that phase of the game a while ago, so I dont\' know.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn all seriousness, this is a MUCH larger chunk of people than is often credited in the oft repeated \"The elite 10%\". It\'s more like 30%, maybe even more. The NToV game (or more appropriately, the post HoT game) is a mid level game these days, and quite frankly, people dont\' STAY at that level of the game for very long.</t>','3b773c6abc88a1cb766f3970f671d863',0,'','3k1fe85a',1,0,'',0,0,0,1,0,'',0),(1196,195,3,52,0,'198.86.16.250',1506690717,0,1,1,1,1,'','Re: Dear developer team: One knight\'s view of Warriors.','<t>Come on, let\'s not skew numbers here. 750 total out of 2000 on at any time...those 750 aren\'t always on, are they?

This is the group that has the most number, the largest demographic. I care about balance as much as the hardcore people. Are you implying my game time shouldn\'t be as qaulity as yours since you play more? We both pay the same amount, yet you should get the benefits of class balance, not me. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPersonaly, I think a lvl 20 warrior should be just as balanced as a lvl 35 warrior should be just as balanced as a lvl 45 warrior. If you make warriors leaps and bounds ahead of knights at tanking from lvls 20+ then you will hurt them in an area where balance exists. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOne last note, then I\'m probably done with this thread since it\'s getting to be pretty pointless. Top end paladins are seeing right at 8k hp\'s buffed. Furor is seeing 9k hp\'s buffed in the last screen shots I saw. I\'d call a 1k difference pretty big. Your average paladin won\'t get near that though because your average paladin is not 64 with AotC to stack with everything. So, on average a paladin is still running right at 80-85% of warrior hp\'s.

Its used only occassionally in groups, so its impact is on par with LoH.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat 8k Paladin you so casually discuss will tank a hell of a lot better than a 6k Warrior, and he gets his spells on top of it. Why is that? Its because the Paladin has better gear. The gear is actually more important than the class. All the Warrior\'s vaunted specialization doesn\'t mean crap without the gear to back it up. Where as the Paladin non-tanking functions aren\'t as gear dependent, while his tanking funtions are. And this is where the great inequity comes from. <br/>\n<br/>\nOnce a Paladin has sufficient gear to successfully tank he automatically (from paying a small trival fee at a vendor for the majority of his spells) has far superior agro control. Not just the top end Paladins. Not just the Paladins in the very best of the best gear. Every freaking Paladin in the game. A poorly geared Paladin will in all likelihood still hold agro better than the best geared Warrior in the game.<br/>\n<br/>\nYet the best geared Paladin will beat the poorly geared Warrior in tanking pretty much hands down. Oh yeah, but we do get defensive. I guess that makes it all okay since a small percentage of the Warriors in the game will actually ever be MTing regularly in order to take full advantage of it. While every Paladin in the game has the opportunity everytime they tank for a group to utilize their advantage. Seems fair, right?

We are on same tier and have the same basic level of gear.<br/>\n<br/>\nLastly, paladins are more then just their store bought stuns. If that is all you buy as a paladin you will not go far.

You can come here and spread fallacious information regarding how much better warriors are than Paladins at tanking, but thats simply not true. The ONLY difference that exists between equal-level, equally-equiped paladins and warriors are skill caps and HP. The skill caps come only in the form of avoidance, not defense. The HP gap is growing significantly smaller. Please, show me the other difference. Ac is not as big a deal because there still exists a tremendous drop-off in utility after 1200ish.<br/>\n<br/>\nWee, we still have a raid role. Oh jump for joy. No, wait a minute, quite a few mobs can be tanked without use of warriors. Last night, we had an SK main-tank Aedin\' Darr, who has reasonable melee damage output. Not becuase we didn\'t have enough warriors; we actually had 6; all with at least 1 EB weapon. Nevertheless, the SK tanked. Thus far, I\'ve only fought 2 mobs that we simply could not use a hybrid to tank; Burrower and AoW. and Burrower is questionable, I have a feeling hybrids will be able to tank him.<br/>\n<br/>\nFine, warriors are prefered over hybrids for raid tanking.

Therefore, we needed a class that could sustain decent damage, but could agro without weapons. Hmm, last time I checked, this is something warriors don\'t do very well. So, all the adds were tanked by hybrids and we won.

Pure melee, a paladin does 90% of the damage warriors do. This has been explained over and over. We share damage tables, andthe only difference lies in skill caps, which account for about 10% more damage; not very hefty difference there. Other differences outside of discs don\'t exist, since Duel-wielding provides less damage than 2-handers, and hybrids get better 2-handers than warriors. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you\'re gonna go into the casting aspect, allow me to present another argument. Other group members, especially those without heavy reliance on mana for damage have to work a lot harder to control their agro with warriors tanking than paladins. Control agro means less damage; they have to evade more, and stop attacking more with a warrior in the group. So, while you personally do less damage because of your casting, the group does more damage as a whole because of your superior agro skills. <br/>\n<br/>\nQuote:<br/>\n\"Have to watch gear closely. I need AC, Hp\'s, sta, wis and mana. Give up one to get the other.\"<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nRight. See, I forgot that warriors need pay no attention to their gear. Let\'s see, AC, HP, sta, dex (we need to proc our EB right), regen (moreso than paladins since they can self-heal), DS, atk. Not to mention the fact that our velious armor becomes useless a lot faster because of the general lack of HP on most pieces. <br/>\n<br/>\nYou\'re twisting the gear extreme way too far. No one is suggesting that warriors in planar armor should tank better than knights in VT. However, with equal equipment, warriors should be able to tank significantly better; something that simply doesn\'t happend.<br/>\n<br/>\nQuote:<br/>\n\"The problem we are facing is that warriors without eb wpns are unable to hold agro in most groups, and that post VT paladin hp\'s/ac have closed the gap on warriors. Solution is to either add in eb wpn drops at lower levels or else alter taunt so that it works better then now. To fix the hp/ac gap simply adjust current warrior gear to have better stats, or add in some new gear that is warrior only with say \"tank mod 10%\" that will adjust your hp\'s/ac by 10%. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you can\'t see that then I\'m just wasting my time typing here. Although if you want you can keep talking about gear not being used in determining how well a class tanks. My wife and I both got a good chuckle out of it and I\'m sure we can get more laughs out of it later. \"<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSee,here\'s the problem. Your first paragraph illustrates our point. We need tanking upgrades; in the field of agro and better defensive abilities. The difference is, these \"mods\" shouldn\'t be coming from certain equipment. They should be permanent. Just remove /disc defensive and put us on separate mitigation tables, where we take 10-15% less damage than any other class.<br/>\n<br/>\nAdding perks to equipment is a shitty bandaid in avoiding a critical problem. EB weapons should illustrate this fact, and even they fail to completely address the issue. THe fact remains, warrior taunt is broken, and our defensive capabilities are lacking. Just put us on separate mitigation tables, remove /disc defensive and fix up taunt. We\'re not asking for much here; I believe those fixes would make most warriors happy without achieving any outside imbalances.<br/>\nWilhelmm D\'averam<br/>\nWarlord of the Apocalypse<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWilhelmm\'s Profile</t>','f2cdb69551d666b630126c5e6f640679',0,'','3tli1ksg',1,0,'',0,0,0,1,0,'',0),(1210,195,3,52,0,'198.86.16.250',1506691056,0,1,1,1,1,'','Re: Dear developer team: One knight\'s view of Warriors.','<t>I\'ve had that same idea myself, just make us mitigate as if /defensive were permanent, and do so without lowering our offensive ability in the bargain.

I know this beause I HAVE EB, and gaining initial aggro is STILL quite dificult.<br/>\n<br/>\n2. Uhm... I call BS on Chavr\'s \"If a Paladin and Warrior are equally equipped\" argument, because he\'s literally ignoring anyone post NToV, which is a significant chunk of the game. ANYONE at NToV and beyond (which is hardly high end) has this extremely narrowing gap in AC/HP. This may or may not be a \"gear\" problem, but it\'s a problem which MUST be addressed. You can pick out narrow areas of the game where one class or another has an advantage (for example, for 50k, a Paladin can buy a full suit of DW armor including Legs/BP, whereas for 50k, a warrior can put a down payment on Cobalt pants, and be another 30k away from a bracer) The fact is, at MOST points of the game, the Paladin has the advantage in terms of tankability. AND, just because post-60, soloing isn\'t a viable option... all the way TO 60, it is for the Paladin and ISNT for the warrior, we\'re STILL the #1 most group dependent class in the game, and this should be rewarded and always HAS been by being among the most desirable. Do NOT lose sight of that.<br/>\n<br/>\n3. Compaing raid buffed Paladins and Warriors in terms of exp group tanking is BS as well, because with Brell\'s/AotC, 500-700 HP is gained by the Paladin.<br/>\n<br/>\n4. Glatius is dead nuts on... there is no balance between the aggro generation advantage of the Paladin and the tanking advantage of the warrior.

It is a small, vocal part, but in no way is it a majority. You have stated yourself gear from this level is what closes the gap. So fix the gear in this level. Do NOT boost the class at every level based on a deficency for a small portion of the players. DW is the suck btw for a paladin. Not enough wis/mana/hp/sta to really be useful. The legs and bp are ok, but the rest is just junk. I really don\'t see how the cost or usefulness of DW has anything to do with this discussion though. The basic fact is that gear is scewing the stats at the high end, not the rest of play. If you up mitigation/hp\'s overall, because of the gear problem for NToV+ then you are just being silly. You want a reason to raise hp/ac overall, then you need to show that it\'s lacking overall, not just at a small portion of the game. <br/>\n<br/>\nBrell\'s can be cast on a warrior too.

I\'ll be dead a heck of alot faster if I do though. I can not tank as good as a warrior. Can\'t. Not gonna happen. Been there and died trying. The only time my agro skills are overpowered are in exp type mob situations. Even then I\'m finding stuff in PoP I can\'t tank, even if I can lock agro. I am aware that agro in exp groups is messed up and I AGREE that warriors need a boost here. HI HI, the whole part about adjusting taunt on exp type mobs so that a warrior can hold agro pretty darn good. Warriors still shouldn\'t have the fast agro like a knight, but they should be able to lock agro in a reasonable amount of time. The fast agro should be for knights as they are med/light tanks, used for catching bad pulls or for taking agro from casters. MT should always be a warrior job primarily, and a knight secondarily. The reason this isn\'t happening now is the length of time it takes non EB warriors to get reliable agro. It\'s faster to let a knight tank, and just add some more healing in a group to make up for it.

As it stands now without factoring defensive in a knight tanks about 1.5% worse than a warrior due to skill caps, has about 500-700 hps less than a warrior, and holds aggro at least twice as well. The main thing warriors are concerned about is how well we tank and how well we hold aggro. Those are the two aspects of knights that concern us. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf a knight holds a massive aggro advantage over us then the only justification for that would be a massive tanking advantage for warriors. That\'s out of the question though because that would be game breaking. The solution is a happy medium. Warriors are supposed to tank noticeably better than a knight and hold aggro noticeably worse. Right now warriors do NOT tank noticeably better than a knight unless defensive is used and they hold aggro FAR worse.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think the devs are reluctant to increase warrior mitigation because when added to defensive it would affect raid dynamics significantly. The solution to this would be get rid of both defensive and evasive. Put warriors on a separate mitigation table with about 15% better mitigation than knights.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe taunt problem isn\'t easy to fix either because they put EB weapons in as a crutch because of taunt being broken. I think taunt needs to be changed so that it\'s a little more effective than EB procs are and EB procs need to be changed to DDs, lifetaps, etc. I have a BoC and combined with taunt I think my aggro is almost but not quite where the average warrior should be compared to knights. If they fixed taunt without nerfing the EB proc then warriors with EB would hold aggro too well.<br/>\n<br/>\nThose two fixes would make both the average and the uber warrior able to taunt effectively, but not as well as a knight and tank 15% better independent of gear. With the HP gap closing due to buffs and equipment, plus the cap on CH at 7500 the HP advantage of a warrior becomes almost irrelevant once a knight gets past 7500 hps.<br/>\nKhumak<br/>\nOverlord of Primordial Fury<br/>\nMith Marr</t>','036a4478815c1a4a9e30a0cc93ea2a50',0,'','1n97fzah',1,0,'',0,0,0,1,0,'',0),(1225,195,3,52,0,'198.86.16.250',1506691263,0,1,1,1,1,'','Re: Dear developer team: One knight\'s view of Warriors.','<r><QUOTE><s>[quote]</s> I think the devs are reluctant to increase warrior mitigation because when added to defensive it would affect raid dynamics significantly.

It is more fun to add things like spells (paladins are getting a couple new heals on test today) than to try to figure out ways to fix the unbalancing problems they created. They don\'t care that warriros don\'t taunt as well as knights and that knights tank nearly as well as warriors because warriors still play and still tank. And at least right now, still get exp groups. Though it seems to be a growing trend that warriors just aren\'t. <br/>\n<br/>\nWarriors need to be upgraded with something more than just /shield. Our mitigation could be the thing that needs to be upgraded, I don\'t think it would hurt VI to at least try out a warrior only mitigation upgrade on test. But then I think there needs to be a warrior only upgrade to taunt and <br/>\nwe should be getting more hps per level gained. Or perhaps in liu of al that, some damn utility and a friggen AA, selos speed horse. Utility and a nearly free, fast horse couldn\'t possibly be game breaking.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere should be more to a warrior than just hitting auto-attack and taunting every 4 seconds (ok defensive on a raid and the occasional /shield). We are a pure melee tank but we are left out classed by the knights and that leaves us nothing to do.<br/>\n<br/>\nGroups and clerics don\'t care that we can mitigte damage just a little bit better, or that we have 8k raid buffed hps, or that we do a little bit more damage because we bring 0 utility to the group and less agro generation than a knight. So groups have been wanting knights over warriors.

But if you do so, why should the statement that Warriors\' advantages as tanks should be primary visible on raids, be unvalid? The days of groups of pure specialists ruling the game were a pain and really should be over - at least for the xp group play. As stated before, knights and other non-specialist classes mostly have certain roles on raids already that differ from the specialists\' roles. Knights, as Warriors aren\'t chosen because of their spells, but because of their tankability, if a group has a tank they won\'t take another usually. Bring this \"but I\'ve seen Paladins being...\" blabla and I return to you a \"and I\'ve seen Warriors being...\" blabla.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you have a Cleric, you don\'t take a Druid as additional healer neither, you\'d take him for DPS/Evac, you wouldn\'t take a Shaman for heals neither then, you\'d take him for Slow and buffs. That is not the case in the tank spot, knights\' spells aren\'t nearly as mighty compared to the Druids\' DPS or Shaman\'s slow which those classes can add when they don\'t need to be MH. Thus, again, we don\'t get chosen for them when the MT spot is filled. Here now I place my \"Period\".<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd also I said before, I have no problem with Warriors getting the here often asked for Mitigation advantage, as long as the game doesn\'t get designed around it and even more EB weapons or better taunters litter the game. Or else they could get a small taunt upgrade and some fun/usefull AA.<br/>\nBut never better Mitigation AND better taunt / AAs. If that would happen, EQ would defacto be reduced to a one-tankclass game (again?) and Knights would need something as powerfull/needed as Slow (read: as Slow, I don\'t ask to get Slow) to fill another role in the game. That is rediculous though as you all certainly think, but only one class being a viable - and a large margin makes a class solely viable - choice for each category makes composing a group so much harder... It is still the same with healers and Crowd Control: If one wants a really fun camp, one still mostly has to choose Cleric and Enchanter. Druids are still LFG too often, Enc/Brd are still too rare to be a \"forced\" addition to the group. Forced meaning that one really should have them to have some fun without too much downtime, Rootparking is far inferior than the mesmerization line, if a class uses mana there isn\'t really another choice than the clarity/manasong line, who actually gets FT 15 or 18 and still hunts in areas where that would really be enough?<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry, you Warriors get my support (as much as it\'s worth to you anyways) to get some needed tweaks and upgrades. But never would I support you placing me to a state of pre-melee patches again - with the sole statement that you specialists should be the best tanks. Spoken based on skills and gear it would be true, factoring mana into the equitation it doesn\'t anymore though. There must be a way to make the versatility usefull and Knights HAVE to use mana to get close to a Warrior in Mitigation (meaning not real mitigation, but rather negating dmg taken with heals for example and increasing the mitigation of groups indirect with their agro skills). There is the danger of them being out of mana though, and that danger can be huge at times, which justifies some other spells for versatility as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nMana and spells aren\'t only a gift we get in addition to some of your skills, we have to use them to actually get close to you. By using all of them we still don\'t reach your tank skills on the HP/AC/Avoid/Mitig side, and surpass you a lot on the taunt side, the gap on one side is too small though, thus you need - and I support - some carefully implemented upgrades there, if most of you mean it would be done by more Mitigation, well why not? As long as the gap together with EB powered taunt skills doesn\'t grant an unfair advantage to you, you deserve it. If it makes all groups only seek Warriors for PoV/S, Hoh, BoT anymore, it was too much.<br/>\n<br/>\nShay</t>','9af6f7b761d77de11a2cf26e093d5aa3',0,'','14wrqwu8',1,0,'',0,0,0,1,0,'',0),(1228,195,3,52,0,'198.86.16.250',1506691291,0,1,1,1,1,'','Re: Dear developer team: One knight\'s view of Warriors.','<t>Clerics are the best healers. <br/>\n<br/>\nShamans are the best slowers.<br/>\n<br/>\nEnchanters are the best at croud control. <br/>\n<br/>\nDoes this mean others cannot do those jobs well enough to get by in an exp group?

Also the direction of class balance efforts in the last year shows that. Hybrid tanks were made stronger tanks, Melee and Spell DPS classes got their dmg made more similar, Monks got their defensive skills lowered to show more clearly that they are offensive, non-Cleric healers got better heals, Bards a strong Mez song with PoP (I think as I didn\'t really look at it).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe game is created around having those categories in mind, tested with assumingly the specialists grouped, then having the difficulty lowered by *shrug* 10 (??) percent.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe point here is: As versatility was never supported like specialisation there are two ways to increase/lower the chances for groups of all classes to an equal level:<br/>\n1.) Design the game around it, i.e. have 50% of the zones be designed around versatility classes (making lev needed, having the requirement for every class of a group to be able to heal a bit for whatever reason, ). This would mean a lot of revamps and adjustments.<br/>\n2.) Get the versatility classes closer to the specialists\' skill levels of their categories, make their versatility skills either support of those core skills (e.g.: stunspells were meant as caster interruptors and are now taunt for Paladins), or transform them into their raid role - leaving the vers. skills as maybe a little toy for xp groups.<br/>\n<br/>\nVersatility classes of a certain category must be able to reach the same accomplishments as specialists while having to use their versatile skills to get them about on par with the specialists. Then, counting in the OOM risc (when using tanks as an example), they need a few benefits from versatility to help them stay attractive for groups. Else, why should I take a tank that can go OOM and lose half his power when I could take a specialist tank and not have that risc?<br/>\nThis situation is not in place, and bringing it in place would require a HUGE revamp of the spellbooks and skill trees of the vers. classes. It would mean for example (simplified) that Paladins have 3/4th the unbuffed HP/AC of a Warrior, have to use a self buff every 5 minutes to get themselfes to the exact ammount each, have the same DPS with another self buff, the same taunt, and a LoH as offset for the risc of them going OOM.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I want to say is that a group for the average pickup xp grind should NOT have to seek a certain class out of a category to max their revenue of the evening. They should be able to chose any class of the category for the job they still lack. In this context one can also see that the category of healers is not yet quite balanced neither:<br/>\n- Clerics are the kings by still a large degree, thus actively seeked and bribed for groups.<br/>\n- Druids, while having a good ratio heal now, still are not able to close the gap of their healing power compared to Clerics with their added damage, i.e. the dmg a Druid can deploy while being MH does not cut a deep enough dent into a mob\'s HP to bring it down fast enough to save the mana for the Druid which he would need more than a Cleric.<br/>\n- Shamans with their Slow often surpass the Druids\' healing skills but on the other side many times only function in combination with a Cleric as healer<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, history made Druids not be all in one line if they should be healers or nukers, history of the game made Shamans rather want to be (de)buffers. that is ok for them, but for the group play it still is devasting. How often did you seek a Cleric for the eveing\'s xp, quest kill or farming? The same with Crowd Control, how often did you look for an Enchanter to do the job, then, after not finding one for some time, you tried for Bards, and when deperate enough maybe even for Necromancers. And if you had an Enchanter, you didn\'t need a Shaman anymore, and no Bard neither for their other skills. For the everyday play this IS devasting, there is a lot of fun to be enabled for their customers by VI if they are able to tune this. They want people to group and then to sit for hours at a spot hunting for xp or quest pieces and sellable loot. No sane entertainer wants people to wait for an hour before they can have fun!<br/>\nOnly in the tank category so far groups actually can freely choose between all three tankclasses, while still one is the best (but no doubt needs some tweaks, that\'s what this thread is all about).<br/>\n<br/>\nOnly for raids the best-in-a-task-classes shine as there is usually a broad enough class mix and several groups. On raids, only the Clerics heal while the others backup them, only the Enchanters CC while the others backup them, only the Warriors tank while the Knights offtank adds. Only on raids the melee DPS classes do the big sustained damage while the spell DPS classes do the huge fast damage.<br/>\nThe classes that do not have such a core role on raids usually are a bit stronger in soloing, some times even depending on the degree they are behind the corerole-class.<br/>\n<br/>\nAside from oldtimer concepts about classes in many peoples\' heads the DPS (melee and spell) category in itself and the tank category in it self are balanced (again: aside from some tweaks here and there).<br/>\nPeople though are more and more getting to a point where they say, Knights are the best xp group tanks. I do not consider that fair, as I am sure that people would in future search for a Knight for 30 minutes before they grab the LFG Warrior right next to them. I want in this thread work for some slight enhancements for the Warriorclass that make them strong enough to have people really not care what class they let tank for them in an xp group - aside from equally spread personal preferences. <br/>\nAnd to clearify, I am asking for the xp group tank spot being fillable by three classes, I am not asking that the raid tankspot should be like that or that I want three nearly identical classes - I hope I pointed that out enough in this thread and made enough suggestions about how to reach right that. On top of that this equal ability to do the job should range throughout the level range and guildtiers, but at least should exist for the top five guilds (or at very least for the top two) as most people can / will reach that point if playing more than half a year and being willing to advance in the game.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd again I will repeat my opinion: I am fully inline with Warriors needing the asked for Mitigation upgrade, I am just bombarding the idea of xp groups most times being better of with Warriors as tanks than with Knights, I am not asking for them to be worse of with Warriors, but not better please.<br/>\n<br/>\nShay</t>','d8879bbf56c87a59f214cbc6dc916725',0,'','1bmfgj1f',1,0,'',0,0,0,1,0,'',0),(1230,195,3,52,0,'198.86.16.250',1506691311,0,1,1,1,1,'','Re: Dear developer team: One knight\'s view of Warriors.','<t>/shrug<br/>\n<br/>\nWarriors have been left behind for 3 expansions now, too many devs play knights and zero play warriors.<br/>\n<br/>\nAbashi+Necros to the Nth degree.</t>','126385f8cdda5d2b2ec556a65f86c9da',0,'','1run0xj2',1,0,'',0,0,0,1,0,'',0),(1231,195,3,52,0,'198.86.16.250',1506691320,0,1,1,1,1,'','Re: Dear developer team: One knight\'s view of Warriors.','<t>I totally and utterly disagree.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen a class is specifically designed to do ONE thing, then they absolutely should be the \"best\" at it. I want to repeat something that seems to get totally lost in these discussions. A warrior is hard wired to not be able to advance without a group from about level 20 on. We were designed with that weakness. We\'re totally and 100% dependent upon a group to advance in EQ. A Paladin on the other hand is NOT. Until the post-60 game, soloing most cerainly IS an option for the Paladin. <br/>\n<br/>\nThere used to be a tradeoff... the most group dependent classes happenned to be the most desirable in a group. This is what we call \"balance\". You may want to call it \"holy trinity\", I don\'t. It\'s nonsense that a group comprised of the strongest soloing classes should be as effective as a group comprised of the relatively weakest solo classes. <br/>\n<br/>\nEvery warrior on this board can tell you a horror story of the limitations of warriors and their dependence on groups and equipment. It\'s called the \"naked corpse run\", and I can tell you right now, more warriors have lost more experience and levels from this little phenomena than anything else I\'ve ever seen in this game.<br/>\n<br/>\nHell, take a warrior and Paladin at level oh I don\'t know...18 and put em both in Paludal caverns... which one will solo and which one will sit at the zone LFG because he cannot survive solo due to the disease dot? You see, all your valid arguments aside, warriors are LFG earlier and more often than ANY other class besides clerics, and it goes THROUGHOUT their EQ career. Now, when it comes to the point where soloing is over, and you want to group out of necessity you want to be as good at it as me? You think that you should have an \"equal\" shot at the group spot that *I* have had to fill for the last 40 levels simply because you can no longer solo as efficiently and that\'s your role of choice, whereas mine is my role out of NECESSITY?

Beastlords aren\'t a \"slowing class\" even though they\'re acceptable slowers and buffers. <br/>\n<br/>\nI can\'t figure out for the life of me why warriors didn\'t jealously guard their position like clerics and wizards. perhaps from pride, from liking being \"the best\" and the only threat being when someone told them they weren\'t, but balance has gone down the crapper, there is no more \"tradeoff\" for being the MOST dependent on equipment and groups in the game, only \"an equal shot\", this is utter BS.</t>','3a294feab1a2ea41573fe8e435e071a0',0,'','1qn9qoot',1,0,'',0,0,0,1,0,'',0),(1232,195,3,52,0,'198.86.16.250',1506691328,0,1,1,1,1,'','Re: Dear developer team: One knight\'s view of Warriors.','<t>Bah... it\'s all BS.

Only in the tank area this is the case so far (apart from small needed tweaks :p ), a camp that is a challenge with a Cleric is about undoable with a Druid and his heal/damage combo as the Druid cannot invest mana into nuking there if he has to heal a lot. Those skills do not stack sadly.<br/>\nWhat I said was that no one should match the pure healing of Clerics, but that a class should be able to cut the need for heals by lessening the mobs\' DPS by killing it earlier (then medding up a bit so it is not more efficient to be with a Druid than with a Cleric) and the other by slowing the mob down and hastening the PCs (as is).<br/>\n<br/>\nSimplified: If with a Cleric a group needs 60 seconds to get a mob killed with the Cleric casting 6 CHs, the same group with the Druid should need like 50 seconds for the kill, having the Druid casting 5 (less efficient) heals, blades and a nuke maybe, and then 10 seconds longer medup.

Why not, I do NOT veto that.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo what degree - this is the core now, of course it is possible to make Warriors be able to take hits 20% better in all factors touching it AND increase their taunt to a point they don\'t have nearly any problem holding agro anymore. The people playing this class asking for right that are the ones that have no clue of balance, or are so idiotic about this game already that they don\'t see that the 12.5$ I invest into my tank class is worth the same as theirs. People want Paladins to tank first, BMB, HWoP, CelCleansing, are gimmicks we add to a group, stuns are our tools. When there is a Warrior as tank in a group, Paladins won\'t be taken and vice versa.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI ask that all three tank classes can make a group equally efficient by using all their toys, Warriors non-mana based, Knights with their respective spells. If that is not the case, People will favor that class clearly when putting together a pickup group. As of now, many of you want to be the best tanks for groups (i.e. get more than 33% chance to get a group) and on raids, leaving Knights as best soloing tankclass, what a joke!! Because I can heal back the dmg I take over a Warrior I shall solo?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat is my freaking role if I am not taken as group tank anymore? If I am taken as grouptank as often as a necro as Mezzer? Backup healer? Not needed mostly. Raidbuffer? YAY a freaking 325 HP one Paladin can MGB if the raid actually would need it. They can\'t lose HoV, VoQ, SoV,but BSS no problem.<br/>\nIf Warriors have a clear advantage in HP/AC/Mitig/Avoid and only a low disadvantage (even less with EB) taunting, who should take us? Soloing? Yes, we solo exactly one LoH better than you, i.e. 5 to 10 seconds, then we got eaten.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome of you actually suggested points that were balancing enough for both sides, I agreed on them from my personal view, now some others want to become god classes again, honestly those that act like that, creep back into your hole of neglecting facts! Loading, please wait, bye bye!<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, serious again:<br/>\nWarriors of the pre highend game need some minor taunt upgrades. If they are innate or skill/AA based they overpower the Warriors once they get into the highend game, thus should be item based (e.g. lower version of EB in Gore/Vindi level guilds).<br/>\nWarriors of the highlevel game need an advantage in HP or Mitigation, a true 20% should be in place. That actually could be AA based, if it is true that the highend gear for Warriors and knights is either the same or lessens the gap any other way too far.<br/>\n<br/>\nHello!? *bonk* Anyone actually recognizing that I want to see upgrades for your class, defining upgrades, but not upgrades that make me uninteresting to be chosen to tank anymore? Anyone still here that does not want to be godclass? Anyone here that would be fair enough to give Knights a role too? And that they are tanks?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat is so wrong for Knights to do the same job as you do with other toys than you have, toys that, as yours, can be a blessing and a curse? Knights are versatility tanks while you are specialist tanks, but you want only specialist to be supported and versatility not? that is a bit narrowminded in my eyes, I have to admit. Btw, you still are stronger on raids while we are stronger soloing, the only difference is that VI wants to squish soloing while enforcing groups and... raids!<br/>\nIf there is only one real tank available that can do the job, it would be better for any guild if the SKs start over as Warriors and the Paladins as Clerics, offtanking, DPS and heals would be secured - if not even increased, and groups would be fine too I guess *gets frustrated with some Warriors now*<br/>\n<br/>\nShay</t>','e2f2b997e994c8ffcd4907b323451163',0,'','21fxel3c',1,0,'',0,0,0,1,0,'',0),(1243,195,3,52,0,'198.86.16.250',1506691460,0,1,1,1,1,'','Re: Dear developer team: One knight\'s view of Warriors.','<t>Shay, u just don\'t understand...<br/>\nWhy these dumbass warriors so freaking stubborn on claiming the best and the only tank position in game?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe reason is:<br/>\n<br/>\nIF WE GIVE UP THIS ROLE OUR LAST PIECE OF PRIDE IS GONE.<br/>\n<br/>\nMost, if not all, fellas here knows that we aren\'t that efficient in tanking day by day.

When your versatility actually makes you a just as good as or better at the role than the specialist class is it becomes a problem. Taunt is a big part of tanking, so you cannot say warriors are the best period, and even without taunt the difference has become so marginal when the hp diff can be made up in one hit in POP. Ac has become almost negligable unless you go really high.<br/>\n<br/>\nLike a lot of people have said here it is a joke, having raided a lot I know knights are fos when they say they have no raid role. After one or two warriors I much prefer knights as extras because of what they bring to the table. They are excellent backup/ae healers, fast taunters, incredibly good self-reliant add tanks (def means nothing unless its damn big hitter if a hybrid can heal himself/herself 3-4 times while tanking an add for us), dispellers, pullers/taunt buffers (SKs), emergency rezzers/Brells buffs/ailment curers (Pallys). What do warriors bring to the raid over a knight if they are not main tank? 10% more mellee damage? Jee wow golly wee. <br/>\n<br/>\nSuggestions for fixing this? Well with EB weapons in game now it would be hard to fix taunt without making it too easy. Even though I was kind of against weapon fixes, maybe the best bet would to be to add taunting blow (not EB) to say Swiftblade of Zek level mobs and up, and maybe an even lesser version on lower weapons. Also make taunt when it is successful (the current % rate of success seems to be improved since POP, so keep the success rate as is) actually give a bit of hate as well, not just put you on top of the aggro list (not a lot, about 100-150 hate IMO). Knights would still be the best at aggro, but the gap between average war and uber war will drastically decrease, much like it is with knights who all get most of their spells easily, and their equipment a damn lot easier to obtain.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso an extra damage bonus on war one handers would be nice, making Dual Wield viable for DPS again. If DWing is gonna take the most ripostes, hence make the warrior take the most damage, it should deal the most damage for what you can get IMO. A 5kpp 2hander in bazaar (Stone Bladed axe of Dismay 44/44) easily outperforms two 1handers of twice the price value each. Something is very very wrong there IMO.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for taking damage, I would say leave the hp diff the same for now, mobs hit so hard these days that its fair that hybrids can tank them with their hit points. I would suggest to widen the gap a bit by putting warriors on a permanent 10-20% better migitation table, and when using defensive to add 35%-25% to add up to the current 45% that defensive provides. I could understand if the evasive disc % was taken down a bit to compensate for this.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyways those are just a few suggestions I can think of for now. At least we all agree that to some extent warriors definately need some kind of fix.</t>','d9464a97b23f3bc1b1e436f994c3217b',0,'','3i04z1gr',1,0,'',0,0,0,1,0,'',0),(1246,195,3,52,0,'198.86.16.250',1506691498,0,1,1,1,1,'','Re: Dear developer team: One knight\'s view of Warriors.','<t>Want us to be able to taunt? Well fortunately i left eq a few times and played other mmorpg\'s.<br/>\n<br/>\nI saw different ways to do things. Hell in Daoc melees could have styles that had effects like spells do, even dots.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut this won\'t work in eq because of how weapons and melee is handled. In daoc we had a sta bar that our styles relied upon. Here\'s the fix. Make our taunt work every time but have it use a bar similar to the one i stated above. Just as a caster has mana we could have say call it an aggression bar. This would allow us to taunt reliably but also fit soe\'s isea that to do so would trivialize an encounter. We\'d eventually run out of aggression as do knights with mana. Remove the taunt skill all together from knights, they do not need it.<br/>\n<br/>\nSecondly we are supposed to have more hps, a significant amount more , than other tank classes.

You still shouldn\'t be as good as it, you get a whole lot of stuff we don\'t get.

If you want to shine in the tank spot on raids and in groups while having Knights only \"shine\" when soloing or duels, you basically say, \"I want to shine where the game takes place, they shall shine where it doesn\'t\". The importance curve is like: XP groups 45% -&gt; Raiding 30% -&gt; soloing 23% - Duels 2%, a bit shifted for some caster classes, but not for any melees, a lot shifted for PvP servers, but those are known for having special rules often times anyways...<br/>\n<br/>\nIf we cannot agree on that the classes within one categorie should shine equally in groups, but differ in soloing and raids, we could just stop this discussion, hope for the devs to work through this, draw the right conclusions and not break any class when they do the needed changes.<br/>\n<br/>\nQuote:<br/>\nEven though as it stands right now Pallys and SKs are the PREFERED tanks PoS/PoV grinds<br/>\n<br/>\nThat is the reason for this thread.

But I cannot understand how so many here can argue that Knights should get back there again, I do want to help you (as far as I can) and not be a martyr (sp?) for you! Why in all heavens should I want to get back to a spot where I\'ve been pre-melee patches only that you get the fun and xp in groups that would not want me anymore? I do not deserve that, I do not deserve to have to rely more on friends than you, I do not deserve to suck at soloing even though it is possible and be less than average in groups while you shine on raids and in groups!<br/>\n<br/>\nKnights ARE tanks, they have lesser tanking skills by skill, AA and gear, but make up that flaw with their spells. If that is not in place, Warrior need to get that sheer HP/Mitig advantages (not Knights lose it, because nerfs always hurt - only a side note). <br/>\n<br/>\nWarriors were supposed to be the distant best tanks pre-melee-patches, VI realized that it didn\'t work out for a part of their customers (Knight players) and changed it. Since those patches, I\'d rather say - even though not officially stated by VI - that Warriors are the best not mana dependant tanks, with the additional role of being raid tanks. Knights are the best mana-dependant tanks with the additional roles of being offtanks on raids, one more offensive, one more defensive. The manabar in EQ for a manauser can be a blessing and can be a curse, can improve a group or slow them down equally.

Knights are just as nice on raids as warriors. 1 Warrior is MT (Usually) others dont contribute other than Dps ..unless there is a need for add tanking (which Pallys can do just fine for also might I add). For our 1 MT spot (which isnt 100percent either all the time) Pally\'s add Brells to raids and can spot heal. So you say we shine because most the time 1 warrior is MT huh? Well in that case I can say Paladins shine because against Undead raid mobs (Arch Lich in Ssra for example) they can crit for 5000+ dmg. That\'s a shine is it not? We dont get anything like that or anything even CLOSE to that kind of AA or skill.. heck in that case you even contribute more dps to a raid not including Brells and Spot heals and cures.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou keep saying how you are paying customers .. yet you neglect the fact that there are MORE warriors then Pally\'s I believe (off the top of my head.. in any case thats kinda irrelevant i guess), and the key is WE are paying customers too!!!

To be secondary on XP grinds? To offer no utility? To have no other options other than grouping ALL the way from 1-65? To add that pathetic amount of dps on raids with my \"Ooooo Ahhhh\" Crits for (28) dmg? I am a paying customer also Shay and this is NOT right. Most my pally friends totally UNDERSTAND my frustration and know why I gave up on my warrior. Its good that you posted this thread .. I do want to thank you for that but understand that this issue has been around for a bit and is getting worse and there is growing tension from the warrior community for SOMETHING to be done.

In order to fix the warrior without nerfing anyone else in the process would make warriors TOO powerful would trivialize raids AND/OR grinds even.

You can not just lump sum say \"he just barely had less hp\'s then me\".<br/>\n<br/>\nYeah, he might have been stunning all nite, but he sure wasn\'t casting group heals and back up heals all nite long. A knights best role is to keep the soft group members alive. If your group is such that you don\'t have any risk in pulls then a knight doesn\'t really have a job. In a safe environment like this a knight has two options. Try to add what dps you can, or tank. All of our wonderful utility spells are useless if only one person is taking damage, and the healer can handle that damage. When that happens we are just the lowest dps melee out there, or we have to tank. In which case, it makes more sense for the lowest dps class to tank, and let the higher dps class (warrior) switch to better wpns and put as much hurt out as possible. In the event of a bad pull, the warrior assumes MT and the knight switches to his primary role of group support. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe problem you discussed is not really that he tanks as good as you. Cause, with atleast 100 less ac then you have, he ain\'t gonna tank as good. What happened was that you couldn\'t hold agro as good. Which indicates that warriors need help with taunt, when they don\'t have an EB wpn, which you don\'t. If you had been able to hold down agro on exp mobs to the point you don\'t ahve bouncing, no one would have said anything about you not tanking. <br/>\n<br/>\nI believe the first thing warriors need is a workable taunt for exp groups so that they can hold agro to the point they do not lose tanking slots to knights. Knights should be used for groups that want added safety, or as tanks when no warriors are around. <br/>\n<br/>\nNow, if mitigation was increased on warriors, would they then be prefered as tanks? Lets say you could take 1/3rd less damage then a knight. Would that really have made much difference in the situation? Sure the group could have let you continue tanking, but since you lost agro occasionaly, the healer would have been forced to heal other group members instead of you. At this point, what does all this added mitigation do for you? Nothing really. It matters not that you can take hits better then anyone else, when you can\'t hold the mob\'s attention for it to hit you. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is why I\'m against the idea of giving warriors added mitigation at this time. Fix taunt so that it works for them in exp groups first. See how that works out. It should fix the main problems warriors are talking about now. That knights are being chosen for groups over them because of agro problems. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf at this point it is evident warriors need additional help in the tanking area, then that should be looked at. I just don\'t see how you can adjust both, without regulating knights to having no role anymore.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nLastly, it\'s very hard to make tanking balance work for everyone. A group only needs on MT. When 3 classes are able to fill that slot you have problems. One class does more dps then the other two, but tanking and dps are the only thing it does. One class has offensive based spells, and the ability to pull. It can outagro the first class, but does so with the knowledge they can\'t take hits quite as well. The last class has the ability to heal and stun, at the cost of being the lowest dps class. This class can also outagro the first class, but once again can\'t take hits as well. This however, is somewhat mitigated by the fact they can stun and heal to make up for the difference. <br/>\n<br/>\nHow do you solve the problems created by this rift in balance? Do you make one hands down the best tank ever, so that no other class is chosen to tank? If so, what do the other two classes do now for groups? One can still pull, and do dps, so there is hope there. The other however is only desired in groups that are in dangerous areas. Since most groups skip dangerous spots for exp and go to areas where they will remain \"safe\", this class is not highly sought after. <br/>\n<br/>\nHow do you balance this out so none feel left out? <br/>\n<br/>\nPersonaly I say you make zones so that they are risky. Make the loot worth the trip, but at the same time, make the risk such that you want the safety class. You want a warrior tanking so a paladin can be saving peoples asses. Make sk\'s useful by being needed to pull. Get rid of the safe, single pull all day long, no risk for nice exp camps... and bring back the dungeons like solb, where you either knew your stuff... or you went groupless.<br/>\nChavr Wyrmbane<br/>\n63 Crusader<br/>\nDruzzil Ro<br/>\n\"New and improved with 10% more healing power, satisfaction garunteed or 90% of your exp back\"</t>','333f7d6a1d244ff16af6cafc164a8018',0,'','2xpx2t7i',1,0,'',0,0,0,1,0,'',0),(1261,195,3,52,0,'198.86.16.250',1506691672,0,1,1,1,1,'','Re: Dear developer team: One knight\'s view of Warriors.','<t>Quote:<br/>\nIn which case, it makes more sense for the lowest dps class to tank, and let the higher dps class (warrior) switch to better wpns and put as much hurt out as possible.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nActually it makes more sense to drop the Warrior and replace him with a Monk/Rogue/Beastlord/whoever.

Sometimes it can have some value, most of the time it appears to not. And if the Paladin can hold agro and be the only one healed when the Warrior couldn\'t then that 100 AC advantage is meaningless. Its more beneficial to the well being of the group as well as more efficient in mana use to have the Paladin tank over the Warrior. An advantage that is completely eclisped by a disadvantage and therefore goes unused is not a meaningful advantage. Much as Paladins say their advantages in buffs over a Warrior are fairly meaningless because the majority are overwritten by Cleric buffs.<br/>\n<br/>\nQuote:<br/>\nI believe the first thing warriors need is a workable taunt for exp groups so that they can hold agro to the point they do not lose tanking slots to knights. Knights should be used for groups that want added safety, or as tanks when no warriors are around.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI agree with this. The problem really is that Warriors can\'t get at the top of the hate list and stay there early in the fight. I would purpose a new ability for Warriors, called furious taunt. This ability would be fired off at will. It would have a duration of 20 seconds and would have a refresh timer of 60 seconds. It would move a Warriors position up on the hate list by an amount roughly equal to a couple of stuns from another class. When it wore off, you would either need to have built up enough hate to stay at the top of the list or risk the mob beating on other group members.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe short duration would mean that it wouldn\'t be in play for the majority of the fight. So other members of the group would still need to use due care. Its refresh would mean that while you couldn\'t use it for the duration of every fight, you could use it for most every fight. This would allow a Warrior a way to generate fast hate at the beginning of a fight while not making aggro control a slam dunk. Additionally it could be made to not work at the same time as defensive, in order to avoid changing the high end raid game significantly.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Man in Black: We are men of action, lies do not become us.</t>','65ef5a7fcb6d022cc4053d91162b2c3c',0,'','1ib0t8dg',1,0,'',0,0,0,1,0,'',0),(1262,195,3,52,0,'198.86.16.250',1506691683,0,1,1,1,1,'','Re: Dear developer team: One knight\'s view of Warriors.','<t>When was the last time SOE looked at these problems with warriors and does anyone think that they will fix them.

The big difference now is that PoP has made quick initial aggro control as important as damage absorption. The penalties for the tank not having immediate solid control of the mob once it hits the camp are too severe for people to accept if there is an option. That option is the Paladin and the Shadow Knight. If this was only a once in a while occurrance then it would probably all for the good. But it isn\'t. If you want to hunt in PoP you\'re universally better off using a Paladin or a Shadow Knight as your group tank.<br/>\n<br/>\nGiven the choice between a capable Warrior who can do the job and a capable Paladin who can do the job, people will choose the Paladin.<br/>\nThe Man in Black: We are men of action, lies do not become us.</t>','fa3668acc4badbdaea4f349934190580',0,'','1b8qn4l7',1,0,'',0,0,0,1,0,'',0),(1266,195,3,52,0,'198.86.16.250',1506691721,0,1,1,1,1,'','Re: Dear developer team: One knight\'s view of Warriors.','<t>I sorta touched this on another post I made, and it got me to thinking.<br/>\n<br/>\nPerhaps it\'s not so much the classes aren\'t balanced as much as it is the game has shifted from risky fighting to safe fighting. I spent a heck of alot of time in solb as I leveled up. Yeah, you could break up the spawns to an extent, but there was never really the thought that a camp was safe. You always had to be ready for adds or for spawns to catch up with you, or for someone moving thru dropping something off on you. <br/>\n<br/>\nNow however most camps are single pull affairs. Adds are few if any. There aren\'t any real dungeons that are worth going to. CT was good, but it was one zone out of countless safe zones. Now it\'s value is diminshed because the exp in it is not worth the time/risk, even if the loot is still fairly nice. Previously dungeons were the only places to go for good exp. If you wanted safe you went outdoors but you watched your little orange bar climb slower. <br/>\n<br/>\nImagine if they revamped guk/seb/velks/Ct/Dalnir/chardok so that they gave the same exp as pov/pos. You\'d have to adjust the mobs up 10 levels or so and redo the loot table to make it worthwhile. That would give people the option of going to a loot equipped zone that is worth the time to hunt for exp, with the added risk to counter it. You want safe/pickup exp for an hour or so, go to pov... you want good solid grinding with loot, go to the new dungeons. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt would make the classes useful again. No one in their right mind would stick a paladin in as MT when you have to be constantly on your toes for adds and group heals. Warriors would be tanking while paladins/sk\'s are working the adds. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I guess it\'s just a pipe dream. PoP was a horrible expansion for content for your average/casual player. Why would they spend time revamping zones when they can just work on the next expansion. Heck, why would they bother looking into balance when they can just make a new expansion. You don\'t get more money for revamping or correcting new content. You do however get more money when people spend that 40 dollars to equip all their characters with the latest expansion.<br/>\nChavr Wyrmbane<br/>\n63 Crusader<br/>\nDruzzil Ro<br/>\n\"New and improved with 10% more healing power, satisfaction garunteed or 90% of your exp back\"</t>','0808a0c4b3f3d9e28b232051e15b66a4',0,'','28ffgufk',1,0,'',0,0,0,1,0,'',0),(1267,195,3,52,0,'198.86.16.250',1506691733,0,1,1,1,1,'','Re: Dear developer team: One knight\'s view of Warriors.','<t>Quote:<br/>\n<br/>\nI wouldn\'t say knights are the pet class<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPaladins are first choice for xp tanks<br/>\nPaladins are second choice for raid tanks<br/>\n<br/>\nAt the same time..<br/>\n<br/>\nPaladins have a wider range of healing abilities than shammy/druid, and are a good bit better than either of those pure priest classes at keeping groups\' health up on raids.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat would you call a class that has that sort of powerbase?

Still there are usually more Warriors in Highlevel guilds than either Paladins or Shadow Knights. That is not a good proof for that the Warrior class deserves more as paying customer, it\'s a proof that the classes are not yet balanced in favor of the Warriors.

Just because a class is popular does not mean its overbalanced. It may just mean that it appeals to more people. When I chose to be a Warrior three years ago I didn\'t do so with the idea of being the premier tank for raids. I did it because I was attracted to the concept of the Warrior. Claiming the classes should be equally represented to be fair, regardless of how appealing one may be over the other for some people, would mean that you would have to stack the advantages in favor of one over the other to compensate. Many people don\'t pick a Paladin, for example, because they don\'t care for the righteous image of a Paladin. Many people do pick a Paladin because they do care for the righteous image of a Paladin. Being a holy warrior wasn\'t my thing. For others it is. How I would perform in a group or a raid wasn\'t originally a consideration.<br/>\n<br/>\nQuote:<br/>\nWhat you gave up (spells) in order to specialize can be a curse for us as well: If you HAVE to use spells to fullfill your tasks but are OOM for whatever reason, you\'re worse than the one that can do the job entirely without mana, and that situation happens, and quite often at that. Knights are actually jealous at times when they see Warriors doing it all with just their swings and a few skill-linked hotbuttons.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI can well imagine that being manaless can be frustrating for the Paladin or Shadow Knight. Many of their abilities are of course mana based. However I would hazard the guess that you are manaless very seledom unless you\'re just not taking the time to med occassionally. Particularly in PoP there is really no reason to pull at a faster pace than the group is comfortable with. And when you\'re manaless you\'re only slightly less effective than a Warrior is normally. While when you have mana you are significantly better at generating initial aggro than the Warrior. And in PoP it is all about the first 20 seconds of contact for group hunting.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, please answer this question. If you have a well equipped Warrior standing next to an equally well equipped Paladin, both of whom have consistantly proven they can tank PoP mobs successfully and well, why would you take the Warrior over the Paladin? In all seriousness. <br/>\n<br/>\nSaying that the Warrior has more HP or more DPS aren\'t significant considerations because the group as a whole is better off with only the tank getting hit and a Paladin can make that happen much more securely than the Warrior. So the group isn\'t going to care about the additional HP and DPS of the Warrior. They have three DPS slots in the group, after all. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe Paladin\'s DPS could be zero and if he held aggro and could take the beating, he\'d still be the better choice. The Warrior\'s additional HP are completely offset by the fact you can safely slow the mob sooner with the Paladin. After all even if we say Warriors have a 1k advantage in HP over Paladins, a 1k HP advantage in PoP is really only 1-3 good hits at most. And a slowed mob hits much less often then a non-slowed mob, as we all know. <br/>\n<br/>\nWith the Paladin tanking, the shaman/enchanter is going to be happier because they can malo/tash/slow sooner and more effectively without getting handed their lunch. The cleric will be happier because they won\'t be getting heal aggro from having to heal the tank before the mob is slowed. And they\'ll also probably be expending less mana over all, since the Paladin will be taking the damage exclusively and with the mob slowed sooner, probably taking less damage overall. The DPS classes are going to be happier because they can unload more on the mob without becoming a target on the hit parade. If you were any other class in the game except a plate class melee, why would you want a Warrior under any circumstances where an equally capable Paladin was available? <br/>\n<br/>\nPoP has finally sidelined the Warrior.

Paladins DO have roles on raids, and strong ones at that, between buffing, group healing, curse curing, dot curing, backup healing, melee damage, crowd control through offtanking, there\'s ALWAYS a spot on raids for Paladins, and even then, in some cases they fill the role of main tank. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen a warrior isn\'t tanking, he\'s offerring melee damage, and remaining in reserve as backup tank, or offtanking. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you ask me, Paladins and warriors have equivalent roles on raids, but the warrior who\'s \"main tanking\" gets more publicity, and therefore it *seems* like he\'s needed more because you really gotta have at least one of em. This doesn\'t necessarily make warriors \"more needed\" on raids than Paladins, as a matter of fact, I\'d argue that there is more of a role for multiple Paladins on raids than multiple warriors, i.e. they \"stack\" better.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe fact that a warrior plays a specific role as Main Tank on many raids and Paladins have other, different roles to fill doesn\'t mean one is \"better\" on raids than another, just different. Nor in my view does the fact that a warrior tanks in a raiding situation diminish the capabilities of a Paladin in the same raiding situation in any way.<br/>\n<br/>\nSoloing: I don\'t think anyone\'s put forth the argument that warriors are even remotely close to Paladins in terms of soloability throughout their career, so I\'ll leave it at that. <br/>\n<br/>\nExperience groups: At this point in EQ, it\'s pretty established that post-60, the Paladin and the Shadowknight are the preferred experience group tanks due to trivial aggro control, and some other intangibles, and very little risk to a group in terms of tankability. This is where the changes need to be made, but your argument is that since warriors tend to take the \"main tank\" role on raids that this should place them as \"equivalent\" tanks in experience groups. My view is different, I think that warriors should be able to be noticeably better at soaking up damage than Paladins or Shadowknights to offset the advantage that Knights bring to the table in terms of aggro control. It should cost a cleric visibly less mana to heal a warrior than it does to heal a Paladin or Shadowknight, this way, the heals that are often cast on other party members due to warriors\' unreliable aggro control are compensated for in the warrior.</t>','1ca51ad87ebd68bab817bc445d3f4ed6',0,'','1jekndrm',1,0,'',0,0,0,1,0,'',0),(1273,195,3,52,0,'198.86.16.250',1506691810,0,1,1,1,1,'','Re: Dear developer team: One knight\'s view of Warriors.','<t>Warriros aren\'t \"sidelined\".<br/>\n<br/>\nThey merely have to fight for groups the same way knights have been doing for years.

This is the same fix that current Eb weapons provide and does not really fix the problem which is INNATE warrior aggro and initial aggro.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy suggestion would be a new skill similiar to taunt that added the amount of hate equal to your skill level.

Aside from the pre 50 game not hurting at all anyways (I know it because I have a Warrior alt of that level), the problem really only exists for Warriors that have no Enraging Blow weapons, if it was a fix itself at first place or not. An innate taunt2 skill would add to the Enraging Blow benefits of Warriors, iliminating their taunt issues entirely to a point where the Knight advantage is really neglectable.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo EQ would get a tank class that is superior in taking damage and only has a very small disadvantage in getting/keeping a mob\'s attention. Knights could not, again not, compete with such a powerfull tank anymore, and their added benefits for a group or maybe even a raid would not be significant enough neither.<br/>\nThe \"risc of an OOM Knight with not really needed benefits\" would only face the chance of small benefits if things go south (adds that are to be offtanked, a backup heal if the MH slacked, minor buffs of neglectable usefullness against the benefits of an additional DPS class, ...)<br/>\n<br/>\nThat is the reason why I suggested something that would get replaced once/if/when the Warrior enters the EB weapon game. There would be two ways as I see them:<br/>\n- introduce lesser EB weapons (with maybe 350 hate/proc) into the lower, but not too low areas of the game, thus Vindi/Gore as examples for the toughness mobs should be to drop those weapons so that people don\'t have their twinks run around with those weapons short after - breaking half the pre 50 game<br/>\n- replace existing EB weapons with fast DPS weapons and rework the entire taunt system so it leaves Warriors (and assumingly also other taunt-enabled classes) at the state they should be. This is the more complicated version though with the really huge danger of breaking the entire game while taking too much time to do other fixes<br/>\n<br/>\nShay</t>','f23183db9677616869569acbd7d211d0',0,'','2cz7vadt',1,0,'',0,0,0,1,0,'',0),(1291,195,3,52,0,'198.86.16.250',1506691969,0,1,1,1,1,'','Re: Dear developer team: One knight\'s view of Warriors.','<t>Fixing the aggro control issue (I won\'t call it a taunt issue because taunt itself is working fine) with items means that only a percentage of Warriors will be fixed.

Raid buffed 8k warrior, Raid buffed 7k Paladin. Group buffed, there\'s NOT 1k difference, so let\'s account for that. Warrior will have more like 7500hp due to loss of brell\'s, and the 9/Kazad Combo. Paladin will have only lost the 9/Kazad Combo, but made up for it with AotC/Brell\'s, so there\'s less of a difference now, the paladin will be at about 6900hp (a comparative net gain for the Paladin of about 400hp, and I\'m being generous). So, there\'s 600hp difference now, and little if any AC difference (based on hitting the \"softcap\").<br/>\n<br/>\nOk, factoring in avoidance skill differences, hitpoint differences, and giving a little pad room, we can safely say that the Warrior costs about 8% less mana over time. Essentially, out of 12 casts of Complete heal, the Paladin will get one more than the warrior.

The only advantage the Knights have then are the fast agro they can gain at the beginning of a fight. And that could also be avoided if the Warrior gets 2 seconds before the slow lands while he uses the skill, his DPS and EB procs.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs said: <br/>\n- The Warriors from 55 to 65 but pre-EB need taunt upgrades but no HP/Mitigation upgrades.<br/>\n- The Warriors at 65 with EB don\'t need taunt upgrades but their HP/Mitigation advantage is not sufficient<br/>\n<br/>\nMaking upgrades innate means making them stack with every toy attainable by gear or AA. Giving BOTH enhancements Innate to Warriors would turn them later into tanks with the following advantage over Knights:<br/>\n- 20% better mitigation<br/>\n- 500 more HP (maybe more with Elemental armor)<br/>\n- 5 to 10% more DPS<br/>\n- Sufficient taunt for groups and raids with EB, AE Taunt and the Tauntboost skill<br/>\n<br/>\nand the following opinion:<br/>\nQuote:<br/>\nYour heals aren\'t really needed now.

Putting LEB-Weapons (\"Lesser Enraging Blow\" = e.g. 350 hate / proc) to the loot tables of Gorenaire, Talendor, real Faydedar, Vindi, Velketor and one or another PoP/SoL mob of that caliber would be a very possible way.

Giving those two upgrades innate would make a comparable 65 John Doe Warrior able to tank in PoV/S already - no epic, EB weapons avoided with a skill, good armor (here: SS quest) avoided with a skill, no Knight could do that, also not if he has bought his spells, and that isn\'t fair neither.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs long as classes play in Sebilis, Chardok or Velks, even AR, ME and UP, the taunt problem as well as the Mitigation problem aren\'t that significant, in PoP though they are unbearable visible, thus need to be solved for the players that play in that expansion mainly, not only for Warriors, not only for Warriors and Knights, but also for the people that group with them - or choose who of them will group with them...<br/>\n<br/>\nShay</t>','656e3155b212819f9b6160647f30f8bf',0,'','1l0w38aw',1,0,'',0,0,0,1,0,'',0),(1296,195,3,52,0,'198.86.16.250',1506692008,0,1,1,1,1,'','Re: Dear developer team: One knight\'s view of Warriors.','<t>Quote:<br/>\nOh, and one other thing: the so called 65 John Doe Paladin can buy his stun spells to do the job, but as long as they aren\'t in at least a guild that can farm HoT, Gore and Vindi, they won\'t be happy with their gear in PoV/S anyways<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nArmor gear is a mutual problem for both classes.

I will have to complement the Warriors on having a higher signal to noise ratio, I\'ll wager that it\'s because less emotionally arrested adolescents insist on playing Warriors in every game they play as opposed to the Paladin fanboys.<br/>\n<br/>\nLet me begin with a history of the Tanks of Norrath.<br/>\n<br/>\nKnights have always been able to control Aggro better than Warriors, initially from lvl 30 onwards in the case of pre-RoK Paladins, to the lvl 9 SoL era stuns.<br/>\n<br/>\nWarriors and Knights had strictly equal armor prior to the introduction of Crafted/Planar level armors. At that point, Warriors gained superior armor, which lasted until late SoV/early SoL with the introduction of all Plate/all Melee armors. This returned us to a gear equivalency period that appears to have ended with the introduction of the Elemental armors in PoP.<br/>\n<br/>\nWarriors have always maintained some degree of superior HP/melee skills. These were closest prior to RoK and new skill caps, spiked apart widely with RoK,and have closed progressively percentagewise since that time. Real HP difference is a matter of debate.<br/>\n<br/>\nKnights have typically had superior weapons, from Beta onwards. The superiority of Knight weapons, as some may remember, were attested to by VI during the Betas. This advantage decreased gradually during RoK and early SoV, until the 2h changes and introduction of Knight weapons during mid-Sov.<br/>\n<br/>\nWarriors have had multiple disciplines since RoK. Some of these disciplines have been highly valued, such as Defensive; most are not. Knights had disciplines introduced in SoV. With the possible exemption of the SK HT discipline, these have been widely derided as useless.<br/>\n<br/>\nKnights have had spells throughout EQ. These spells, compared to their Caster equivalents, were of moderate use prior to RoK, lost considerable ground during RoK, and have been progressively improving since RoK.<br/>\n<br/>\nRoK is typically viewed in one of two ways. It was the Golden Age of Warriors, as they were by far the most superior tank in all of EQ. It was the Dark Ages of Knights, as they lost ground relative to everyone and languished. Class populations prior to RoK were far different then when SoV was released. Paladins, once one of the most popular classes, fell considerably in population. Shadow Knights fell from uncommon to near extinct. <br/>\n<br/>\nLate SoV is likewise viewed in two different ways. For Knights, it was the beginning of a grand resurgence, that in their opinion has almost returned parity in tanks to EQ, as it existed prior to RoK. For Warriors, however, it was the start of a long period of neglect that was resulted in what they feel is inadequecy in their role of tank.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe\'ve never really been happy comparing ourselves with each other.<br/>\n<br/>\nPart of these divergent views is the change from the philosophy of Melee, Priest, Caster, Hybrid to Tank, Healer, Damage, Support. It is still common to find members of the older philosophy who believe any Melee should be a superior tank to any Hybrid; this belief is still held by a minority of the Monk community for example. Likewise, in the new philosophy, there are those that believe that a Warrior, Paladin, or Shadow Knight should be interchangeable as tanks, and equally desired; an idea often espoused by Knights.<br/>\n<br/>\nThese philosophies tend to come into conflict using key terms like \"Specialist versus Generalist\" or \"Warrior versus Knights\" and argue over unquantifiable terms like utility. Unfortunately, no one can really agree what utility means, as everyone holds their own definition.<br/>\n<br/>\nWarriors like to point to spell capabilities. Knights like to counter with right-click effects and useful disciplines. Further complicating the matter is that everyone is not playing with equivalent toys. Some people have items that would boggle the imagination of those they argue with. These items complicate even fixed arguments as not all level 65 players are created equal, nor is everyone\'s endgame the same place.<br/>\n<br/>\nI sat here thinking a long time about what I might say to convey my experiences to you, as I believe they have some value. Unfortunately, I\'ve come to the conclusion that most would simply fall on deaf ears, as you\'ve all apparently made up your minds. And in this I do not only address the Warriors in the audience, I address the Knights as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou see, no matter what I might say regarding balance, someone, with a perfectly valid perspective, will simply counter \"Well in my experience, you\'re completely wrong.\" And they\'ll be right, once again, from their perspective. Even our friends the number crunchers are choosing to evaluate by their preferred method.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor the record? I\'m in a near-Emperor post-NToV guild. I\'m one of the better equipped Paladins in my guild, I have approximately 1800 hp less than my friend the main tank raid buffed. He absorbs damage superiorly. I control aggro superiorly.

Not for efficiency, even though our groups are quite efficient. I group with him because he\'s a great guy.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nNoble sentiment. One I don\'t disagree with. Unfortunately one of the realities of EQ is people will group you only once in a while because you\'re a great guy. More often they\'ll group you because you fill a particular role they need filled. And quite often how well you fill that particular role will have a significant bearing on it.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor example, if group wants to hunt in PoV and are lacking a Cleric, its very doubtful they\'ll say, \"Let\'s get Glatius, he\'s a great guy.\" Because of course, I play a Warrior.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd as people become more and more aware of how poorly I can control aggro compared to another great guy who plays a Paladin, they\'re very likely to invite him rather than me. Because one of the major parts of the game being fun is not to spend more time on CR than on accomplishing things.<br/>\n<br/>\nI\'m Joe Warrior. My gear isn\'t steller. My weapons aren\'t steller. I want to play the game just like everyone else does. I can\'t control aggro near as well as I or my group would like. Any Paladin in the game, from one several levels below me in gear far inferior to mine to one several levels above me in gear far superior to mine, can do far better. There is nothing I can do about that. There are no weapons I am ever liable to get that will change that. People are not going to invite me to tank for them when they can get another great guy who can do what they want better, faster, easier, with less hassle for them.<br/>\n<br/>\nMore HP? Doesn\'t matter. More mana is spent healing the people getting beat up because I can\'t control the mob\'s attention. More AC? Doesn\'t matter because if the mob isn\'t hitting me my AC is irrelevant. I dish more damage? Doesn\'t matter if the group wipes because the Cleric got killed after getting healing aggro from keeping the Shaman standing.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am more overhead than what I bring to the table. My advantages to a group as it stands today in PoP are not enough to counter balance the disadvantages to the group as a whole I represent. And people have figured that out.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd it has nothing to do with my skill as a player. It has everything to do with the limitations put on my class. Personally, I don\'t really care about defensive. They could give it to every plate melee in the game and I wouldn\'t give a damn. I find my most enjoyment tanking for a group. Raid tanking tends to be a serious PITA that really isn\'t worth the grief. Particularly when everyone points to it as this big major deal that should cripple us in our day to day playing. <br/>\n<br/>\nI want to be effective in PoP. I want to enjoy playing the game again rather than watching people taking a major beating because I couldn\'t get the mob to be more interested in me than in them. I don\'t want to know that not only would a group maybe be slightly better off with another class tanking, but know that they would be significantly better off with another class tanking.<br/>\nThe Man in Black: We are men of action, lies do not become us.</t>','e098a2b4073971b4be5fd26f01f13297',0,'','1epz3fix',1,0,'',0,0,0,1,0,'',0),(1306,195,3,52,0,'198.86.16.250',1506692089,0,1,1,1,1,'','Re: Dear developer team: One knight\'s view of Warriors.','<t>You can\'t give warriors stun like agro.

Ignore them if you want, try to trivialize them if you can, but regardless, the downsides are there.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nLets use a common one group scenario and examine these downsides, comparing a Warrior vs. a Paladin.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Shaman has cast slow early and is taking a serious beating. Just as the the tank regains the mob\'s attention, the Cleric heals the Shaman and aquires aggro. Cleric is going down fast. <br/>\n<br/>\nYour options as a Paladin: (these are only the things I can think of as a Warrior who doesn\'t play a high level Paladin. I imagine experienced Paladins could come up with more)<br/>\n<br/>\n1. Cast a group heal. This not only heals you, the Cleric, and the Shaman if he needs it, it also produces high aggro.<br/>\n<br/>\n2. Root the mob and move in close, giving the Cleric time to heal himself.<br/>\n<br/>\n3. Stun the mob giving the Cleric time to heal himself.<br/>\n<br/>\n4. Move in close, taunt, then follow up with stun.<br/>\n<br/>\n5. Move in close and FoL the mob, then follow up with a stun.<br/>\n<br/>\n6. Target the Cleric and fire off LoH.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll of these options are available to every Paladin in the game. These aren\'t AAXP abilities. They\'re not gear based abilities.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow the options for the Warrior:<br/>\n<br/>\n1. Move in close, taunt and pray for it to work, pray for a proc to fire, and/or pray for someone else to do something intelligent.<br/>\n<br/>\n2. Fire off AE taunt, if he has it. (And not every Warrior in the game has AE taunt, as hard as that may be to believe.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nDownsides for the Paladin? Less damage output. Of course this really only becomes an issue if mana is running out and the mob needs to drop before the healer runs OOM. Hardly something that is a major problem in day to day hunting I would hazard. The DPS of your tank is of less overall importance than his ability to control aggro. <br/>\n<br/>\nHas fewer HP? Of course this varies greatly. Its perfectly feasible for a well geared Paladin to match or exceed the HP of a lesser geared Warrior, while the Warrior will never match the Paladin\'s aggro control. And even if the Warrior has more HP, its value is only of significance when he is getting hit. <br/>\n<br/>\nBetter mitigation? This one is hard to validate in as much as a Paladin can easily match the AC value of a Warrior given the gear currently available in the game. And while many people believe that Warriors inherantly take less damage than a Paladin, little has been done to validate this. And in your typical hunt it hardly matters unless healing the Paladin is overall more mana than healing the Warrior and everyone else that needs to be healed because the Warrior lost aggro for a moment.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Man in Black: We are men of action, lies do not become us.</t>','cf39c2eac18e35a6a5358a2da24cc5c8',0,'','2f6mavq6',1,0,'',0,0,0,1,0,'',0),(1308,195,3,52,0,'198.86.16.250',1506692109,0,1,1,1,1,'','Re: Dear developer team: One knight\'s view of Warriors.','<t>Downsides to knights<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nLower hp\'s then warriors.

See above for relation to hp\'s.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe above stats means that you die faster when tanking. Stuns semi make up for the loss, but not enough. I can not chain stun 56+ mobs enough to reduce melee damage to the point it is negligible. A warrior will be able to live longer then a paladin in such a situation.<br/>\n<br/>\nGoing oom means a paladin is next to useless. Yes it happens alot. I have 3100 mana and I run oom often enough in groups. Med breaks slow the group down.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe argument that all/all items have destroyed this balance and therefore warrios need a change because of what gear has done to the classes is flawed. If gear is the reason for an imbalance then ALTER GEAR TO FIX THE IMBALANCE! Do not alter the class because gear has closed some gap with other classes. That would be just as foolish as allowing gear to have such a factor in the first place. It\'d be no different then me stating that 1hdrs are useless for paladins because of the ratio\'s, and therefore we should get quadruple attack when using a 1hdr. The real solution would be to look at the ratio\'s and solve the problem there, not alter the class because of a problem with items.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIf a paladin is MT, then our utility is lessened dramaticaly. Yes, we \"can\" cast heals, buffs and whatnot, but the reality is that if your getting hit, your chances of getting a cast off are diminshed. Therefore if a paladin is MT, he\'s basically just a lesser warrior, that holds agro better. <br/>\n<br/>\nHolding agro better is a downside when you don\'t have the tanking power to handle such a mob. In other words, sure I can hold agro, but then I die. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nLowest dps of all melee classes. I have windblade, 41% haste and I average..... 41dps. If I\'m not MT\'ing then I\'m almost always casting something or other during a fight. Either way, I get to do less dps then anyone else with a blade.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, that is what some would call downsides to being a paladin. Personaly, there are no downsides to being a paladin. I love the class, I work around the limitations and I have fun. <br/>\n<br/>\nWarriors need a reasonable upgrade to taunt. Not something that allows them to hold agro no matter what. Something that will build up agro for them as long as the rest of the group plays smart. Yes, agro will still bounce some, but warriors should be able to get it back quickly. As it stands now, warriors lose agro too easy, and take too long to build it back up. Fix that, without giving them the ability to lock down agro and have the problems are solved. After that look at items/gear. Figure out what items warriors need to fix the closing gap on hp\'s/ac and either change or put in new items.

Fletched special arrows which add a specific amount of hate to a mob. This would serve three functions, first it would revive the near-dead fletching tradeskill, second it would give warriors the ability to gain aggro on an incoming mob (but only if the arrows hit, which of course would motivate people to work on their archery, as well as not be \"guaranteed\", but better than the current method), finally, it would prevent a \"fix\" which requires killing raid level mobs and affect warriors throughout the spectrum.<br/>\n<br/>\n2. Make some adjustments to items (Particularly planar armors) to give warriors back some of their \"equipment advantage\" which has dried up since Velious.<br/>\n<br/>\nThose two relatively simple fixes would go leaps and bounds toward solving many of the problems brought up.

An adjustment to taunt would help in indoor zones. Lets say arrows give you 200 hate. Allow taunt to also give you 200 hate. The trick is, to make it cap. I\'d say something like +400 hate would be sufficient. That still keeps agro semi bouncy on warriors, but not to the point it is now. It would allow warriors to have an effective taunt at the start of a fight. It\'s just that as a fight progresses you still have to be aware of hate. <br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe that won\'t work.

I pull however, so I tend to take every point of damage inflicted by an NPC other than enrage. Warriors who do the same average 1-2 Complete Heals, however, as noted, there is a tendency to have other people in the group get hit in that occassion. Mind you, in those cases, it\'s not the clerics healing the other people, I do it instead.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis can be minimized, if you have a high aggro class pull (Rangers via snares, Paladins via stuns, etc.). If you have a low aggro class pull (Warriors) or a class that pulls with a means of then reducing their aggro (Rogues, Enchanters, Bards, Monks) you tend to get ping-pong off the casters untill the NPC settles down.<br/>\n<br/>\n2) Warriors can tank higher DPS NPCs.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hate tanking BoT nameds. Do you know how I do it? I get 3-4 Clerics, Druids, and Shamans together, get real good aggro, and get mass healed till the named dies from my damage shield, the DoTs, and my pathetic melee output. A similar level warrior stands there, tanks with Defensive, and requires half the healing I do or less. The strategy that works for him will not work for me, and the strategy that works for me won\'t work for him. The downside? The considerably more exotic group composition required for my strategy. How many of us group with 4 healers?<br/>\n<br/>\n3) Knights absolutely require top of the line slows.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn PoP, I need to group with a Shaman or Enchanter. Bard and Beastlord slows will not reduce the damage received enough to let me survive long enough to receive that next heal. Warriors I\'ve grouped with can endure the greater punishment from less-slowed NPCs long enough to let that next heal land. Part of this limitation is negated by the post-60 stuns, addressed below. However, please note, they\'re rare, most Knights don\'t have them, and they don\'t work on everything.<br/>\n<br/>\n4) Most Knights not in a name-recognition level guild are absolute idiots.<br/>\n<br/>\nLet\'s be honest. We know they\'re out there. We know they\'re idiots. These are the guys that DA when low on health and the Cleric\'s already annouced a heal incoming, which causes the NPC to kill everyone else in the party, then them once DA wears off. They won\'t LOH anyone, sometimes not even themselves, even when a chanter is keeping 4 adds mezzed and is about to be turned into pulp. You\'re better off having a Ranger tank than these guys. But they\'re out there, they\'re always LFG, and they want to group with you. Knights have many wonderful tools at their disposal. Someone who doesn\'t know how to use them correctly can screw up anyone, anywhere, anytime. By the way? Some of them are hiding in the name-recognition level guilds too.<br/>\n<br/>\nAdvantages to having a Knight tank over a warrior<br/>\n<br/>\n1) Superior Aggro Control allows NPCs to be debuffed sooner, and allows Healers to concentrate on fewer people.<br/>\n<br/>\nI stun. I stun a lot. I stun to pull, I stun when it gets to camp. I stun occassionally during the fight if I\'m tanking. Honestly? When tanking I can forget to turn on autoattack and still hold aggro easily unless someone gets nukehappy. The only time something hits someone is when I get an add or it spawns in the camp. My party members are tashing, slowing, debuffing the NPC while its still on the way to camp. <br/>\n<br/>\nI have all my post 60 stuns. I am very lucky; a lot of casters who I beat on Spectral Parchment rolls are grumbling really hard. I am once again used to something that I\'ve pulled simply stand outside the camp while I wait for stun duration to expire. However, this doen\'t apply to those NPCs that are immune to stuns.

And if you understood aggro and how it works better, you\'d realize that. Its maintaining your position at the top of the hate list that is important.

The very next action that person does will very likely move him back past the Warrior on the hate list.

The person in the second position on the hate list can now do other things without bumping the Paladin.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd please don\'t try and tell me that taunt allows a Warrior to control aggro as well as a Paladin.

It\'s undeniably true that on high DPS mobs, the ability to go \"defensive\" is a major advantage for a warrior. High DPS mobs (i.e. mobs that can outright kill a player before Ch\'s can land) are still the domain of the warrior. Good examples are obviously the nameds in BoT. Now, at the same time, aggro control is even MORE of an issue on these guys than other mobs, because an aggroed party member will die, no ifs ands or butts. I think the tradeoff works well there. You CAN tank them, we\'re better at them, and it works. These aren\'t normal experience mobs though, so it\'s not quite relevant in \"an experience group\".<br/>\n<br/>\nI cannot see how a Paladin can possibly need to take 1-2 more Ch\'s per fight on regular giants in BoT, it just doesn\'t seem mathematically possible.

If you increase the amount of agro control a warrior has, to the point they make an effective split/add tank for exp groups, then a paladin loses his job. <br/>\n<br/>\nMt can be changed out as situation dictates, but split tanks are the realm of the knights. Our spells allow us very fast agro so that casters dont\' get nailed. If a warrior is able to get agro just as fast, with the added bonus of being the better tank, the no one will need paladins for emergencies. The heals are nice, but not really a good enough reason to add a paladin.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThat is why it\'s good to allow warriors to have a small amount of time to build agro. If the group has to wait a bit and allow the warrior to get agro then warriors will not make affective add tanks. The day they are as good at add tanking as knights is the day knights are no longer needed. It\'s just that simple.<br/>\n<br/>\nVerant has stated the role for a paladin is emergencies.

BUT, people won\'t group Paladins and Warriors together. Not as a rule anyway. Its too much of an overlap of functionality which isn\'t really much of an improvement. Two tanks taking damage from two mobs is more than people typically want to have to deal with regularly in PoP. Unlike before, when this was actually a very viable form of crowd control. And if we\'re not both tanking, neither of us bring enough extra to the situation to warrant the overlap.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen it comes down to which of the two is the MOST attractive. And if there is no dramatic difference between the two, its a coin toss. If however, there is, then the class with the advantage will be the one that gets the lion\'s share of the slots.

When you say that a Knight has similar HP to a Warrior of the same guild, you have to say in what area of the game they are: <br/>\nIf they are in the highend game, the Warrior indeed should have more HP/Mitigation, but he dualwields EB weapons and has no real taunt problem anymore. <br/>\nIf they are not in the highend game but maybe wearing SS quest armor visible and \"different\" stuff in not visible slots, the Warrior HAS more HP/Mitigation or he is seriously worse geared from the start, but he for sure has a taunt problem. By the way, a worse geared Wizard will also nuke a lot less than a better geared Druid, thus have less dmg over a certain time...<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile I do not like the taunt arrow solution (how often do you fire anyways before the mob goes in close combat? 2 times?), I like the idea of the innate hate proc skill that replaces EB. Though it might not be innate a SoL class AA (i.e. 59+), granting 12pt/level Hate (780pt at 65, more than EB now) would be a good solution, with a PoP AA at 65 increasing the proc rate (to simulate dualwielded EB weapons). At Arch skill level of 55 there are no specific AAs for any class, so it is very unlikely to place it there. If this gets innate though the xy% Mitigation advantage at 65 to reach a 20% delta shouldn\'t be innate, but maybe placed on items (maybe as \"effect\" on the EB weapons that will lose their proc :p no, honestly, it should rather be on Elemental armor as the \"equal HP\" problem mostly is in place when people are fully geared Vex Thal or better).<br/>\n<br/>\nThis combination of Innate / not-Innate skills is very dangerous though, Warriors in the pre-EB era have more mitigation/HP yet and would get EB-like taunt (i.e. neglactably lacking in taunt). There would be a very hard time for Knights, some weapons with 350 hate/proc (which would help a lot for the beginning but be replaced by EB weapons once available) would suit the gametier better as I see it...<br/>\nAnd if both upgrades are innate they unbalance the pre-highend / pre-EB game vastely.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother point, some Warriors think to be helpfull:<br/>\nI have tested to hold agro with Cease, Desist and FoL and it was visibly harder, I generated maybe half the agro as with Stun, Holy Might and Force of Akilae. Thus saying we can do the job with those low level / low mana spells doesn\'t really hold true.<br/>\nAlso the Stun spells Force, Word of Tranquility, Word of Serenity are spells used for mob placement and not really for taunt. The spells are often too mana costy and have the disadvantage of moving the mob out of range of other melees, thus cutting down their over time dmg. In my opinion (repeat: MINE), if you see a Paladin use the Word of... spells to get agro in a group, you see a bad Paladin /shrug. They really should be used only if the mob needs to be pushed into another direction to avoid it dropping down a cliff, agroing adds or whatever.<br/>\n<br/>\nShay</t>','9aa640590b948dc7ca01974954b93e0f',0,'','hqsideeq',1,0,'',0,0,0,1,0,'',0),(1341,195,3,52,0,'198.86.16.250',1506692443,0,1,1,1,1,'','Re: Dear developer team: One knight\'s view of Warriors.','<t>I think you entirely miss what EB does and how this applies to the \"imbalance\" that is spoken of here.<br/>\n<br/>\nEB is really, more than anything for maintaining your position at the top of the hate list throughout a fight.

You see... let\'s say someone pulls a mob with a shattering hammer... and I successfully taunt off of him. I have crap for aggro as a result. I have the value of the shattering hammer throw +1. This is small, and fairly worthless. Once something lands, tash, malo, slow, you name it, I no longer have aggro. Usually, by that time, I won\'t have seen an EB proc. This (the initial 20ish seconds of a fight) is where the bulk of the imbalance occurs and procs are NOT acceptable tools in this crucial time. This happens to also be where the spells you tested function best. A cease on incoming does WONDERS, a cease+desist and the mob is practically yours. It\'s not throughout the fight that my concern is, but the opening stages. This is why the arrow suggestion, because it\' a ranged aggro attack which we currently don\'t have. All these fancy AA skills which generate hate procs are meaningless unless you can get totally lucky and proc in the opening stages. <br/>\n<br/>\nEB does NOT help there one whit, as stated earlier, it helps us stay at the top by adding numerical hate which is attributed to us. 1-2 arrows with +200 hate would effectively solve the problem.</t>','5e43ecdd96bed0f54ec5f5c7e6767546',0,'','xspjexiq',1,0,'',0,0,0,1,0,'',0),(1342,195,3,52,0,'198.86.16.250',1506692451,0,1,1,1,1,'','Re: Dear developer team: One knight\'s view of Warriors.','<t>I believe Frodlin accurately describes the problem.

They don\'t require an awareness of what\'s happening and the active decision to do something about it.

The same counts for Crits as well, and I do have crits and procs on my weapons, so I know the difference when buffed or swapping out the gear. I even see it on my lvl 50 Warrior when se swaps out two pieces of gear to get from 95 to 105 Dex.<br/>\n<br/>\nStill, no one of you replied (maybe because I didn\'t ask too clearly, hehe) to what you see happening if the Warrior has innate skills to up their taunt so they can build some agro before the mob is in camp and thus hold it through the fight - be in addition or as replacement to/of EB - AND an innate skill that grants them an 20% Mitigation advantage. Innate means that you do not have to be in a certain tier of the game, that a 65 Warrior in full Thurg quest can get it as well as a Warrior in full VT/Elemental.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe gap in Mitigation is right until at least the SS quest armor stage, if not NToV, the gap is too small though when people reach full VT/Elemental as I was told.<br/>\nThe gap in Taunt before EB is too large, as large that it isn\'t fun anymore to play with Warriors as I personally see it, the gap with EB is about right.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, again, Warriors have problems with Taunt before EB, and problems with Mitigation at the Highend. Solving the problem with two innate skill increases is not a viable solution, because it would add a Mitigation bonus in a tier where it is not needed (pre-VT) and a taunt bonus also in a tier where it is not needed (Highend).<br/>\n<br/>\nMost of you played in the level 60, or at least post 50, game for several years now, i.e. you know the status where Knights stood before the melee patches, the SoL and the PoP expansion upgrades to the classes. You know how people choose what class will do a certain job for them, comment how you would like to prevent the impact of Knights\' desirebility of these two changes!<br/>\n<br/>\nImagine I was your guildy, RL friend or even your girl friend, I chose a Paladin because I love that class most (actually I did exactly that, but pre-melee patches it was the weakest paladin design of all RPGs I\'ve ever played). Now I ask SoE one thing: \"I am a tank class and I want to be able to tank as often as the Warriors and Shadow Knights\" ... As often means to get an equal chance for groups, disregarding variating skills to play at all, gear and other groupmembers\' preferences (as those should be spread equally anyways). If you now state that you deserve a better chance for the spot in question, you deserve a /guildremove, a break of friendship or quitting of the relationship right away. I only talk about xp group here, remind you! There is no justification for a \"my class starts with a \'W\' so I should naturally get better chances\" NONE, ZILCH, you are tanks, I am tank, Shadow Knights are tanks, all they do for groups is tank, period. \"Spells...\" And? Even if I had an innate PbAoE-Mez proc, the first reason I\'d be chosen for a group is to tank, that, and nothing else is my job, and I deserve that people let me do it in a game where 1 of 6 spots about must be filled with a tank.<br/>\n<br/>\nSee the entire picture and range of tiers: The upgrades we talk about here are available - if both innate - for a level 65 Warrior who would be boosted to PoV while not being able to leave PoD zin with his gear without the upgrades, and are available for the 65 Warrior in full VT/Elemental gear who is in xp groups in PoEarth. In both cases, equally geared Knights would be left behind because what you get would look like this:<br/>\n<br/>\nA 65 Warrior in full Thurg armor, 1200 HP more + 20% more Mitigation than a comparable geared Knight with 90% of the taunt skill of the Knight and a 65 Warrior with 500 HP + 20% more Mitigation than a comparable Knight, the innate taunt upgrades + dualwielded EB weapons. I tell you, right now it is far easier to hold agro against a chainslowing Enc/Shm than to hold it against a EB wielding (even single) Warrior.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, the changes in taunt are needed, but the taunt upgrade MUSTN\'T be available for EB wielding Warriors, and the Mitigation upgrades mustn\'t be available for a pre-VT geared Warrior. One being available to the wrong tier is acceptable, though it rather be the Mitigation upgrade. This means that either of both only should be Innate or AA based while the other should be gear based. Let me explain why:<br/>\nA normal pickup group in PoV/S for example would much rather like to give a Warrior with the Mitig enhancement the bit more time to build a bit agro than to take a Knight if they kney they could get a tank with 1000 HP more and sufficient Taunt.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe easier and less riscfull solution would clearly be a pre-EB proc for weapons that will clearly be replaced with EB when available, but helps Warriors who got it a lot. The more difficult solutions would be Innate skills in taunt as there is a huge risc to totally unbalance the lower tiers of the highlevel game or a replacement of EB and similar hate generating weapon procs.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nCome on, guys, we are discussing here with the intention to prevent Warriors falling into a state the Knights already passed, not to get the Warriors to where they were before melee patches (i.e. pushing Knights back to where they were back then).

I\'ve got two good reasons for that. I happen to think that Warrior mitigation as it stands today is adequate for the majority of situations. And I also believe that if they upgrade Warrior mitigation then they are likely to do something else as a consequence. What might SOE do if Warriors are suddenly taking damage better than before? That\'s right, they just might beef up the mobs a bit more. Which now means that the Shadow Knights and the Paladins get hit with a double penalty. Not only will their mitigation stay stable versus a Warrior\'s which will increase, the mobs they\'ll be facing will be geared for the higher mitigation. Lose/lose as far as I can see, for the Knights. Just another opportunity to introduce gross imbalance.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe significant point of imbalance as it stands today is not mitigation and its not HP. Its aggro control. And while I like the concept of Warriors having significant advantages in both mitigation and HP, since we are specialists with extremely limited utility, its not worth tipping the balance majorly out of kilter to get, imho. <br/>\n<br/>\nI suggest we focus our efforts on correcting the aggro control disparity because this is the point where the majority of Warriors are suffering the most. Warriors don\'t need to be able to generate as much aggro control as a Paladin. But they do need more than they generate currently in the initial stages of contact. And I am firmly of the opinion it should be done in a way that gives control to the person running the toon and not to the random number generator. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Man in Black: We are men of action, lies do not become us.</t>','4688cdec2ecdb434a15c2715c0a39da4',0,'','26atotvq',1,0,'',0,0,0,1,0,'',0),(1347,195,3,52,0,'198.86.16.250',1506692502,0,1,1,1,1,'','Re: Dear developer team: One knight\'s view of Warriors.','<t>Quote:<br/>\nI actually HAVE EB weapons, and I have avatar on pretty much full time (primal).

So therefore, paladins are rediculously over-powered because they can do all those things simultaneously without ever having to worry about mana and still be better tanks than warriors because of their superior, and therefore they must be severely nerfed of we must be severely upgraded.

So its more important that I keep agro as much as I can.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, please explain to me in detail, how the fact that I could theoretically MT for a raid better than a Paladin or a Shadow Knight because I have defensive available means that the rest of the time I play the game I\'m deserving of having little or no control aggro control while Knights up and down the spectrum aren\'t challenged in this regard what so ever.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaking it trivial for one group and a major challenge for another is not balance. I don\'t object to Knights having better aggro control. I object to having none at my command and rather being a slave to the RNG, which is completely the opposite of the Knights. And if I\'m finding it difficult with willsapper, which is fairly decent, how might those Warriors unable to get anything even that good be faring? Having aggro control be inherant to the WEAPON and not the CLASS means that those who can\'t get the best weapons are doomed to inferior aggro control. While for the Knights it is essentially IDENTICAL up and down the spectrum. Now, please explain how this does not SUCK?<br/>\nThe Man in Black: We are men of action, lies do not become us.</t>','55bd7e338464ec263b0e48ff49de55b2',0,'','10hef99x',1,0,'',0,0,0,1,0,'',0),(1350,195,3,52,0,'198.86.16.250',1506692527,0,1,1,1,1,'','Re: Dear developer team: One knight\'s view of Warriors.','<t>A little solution could be the introduction of a warrior only item with the level 34 SK \"Terror of Darkness\" spell as a right click effect with unlimited charges (lets say a necklace, range item or perhaps a charm).<br/>\n<br/>\nThis item should be attained by a quest in the tier 1 or 2 zones, lets say by bringing in Ethereal Parchments (then that issue is also solved).<br/>\n<br/>\nAdvantages:<br/>\n* It solves to a lesser extent the initial agro issue. <br/>\n* It isn\'t broken on raids because the higher level SK hate spells will overwrite it anyway.<br/>\n* Warriors will get compensation for the parchments (now we just have to find something for the monks and rogues).<br/>\n<br/>\nBorix</t>','44774b9a6b75af1a86cc9f9cfb6fb40a',0,'','178aipps',1,0,'',0,0,0,1,0,'',0),(1351,195,3,52,0,'198.86.16.250',1506692532,0,1,1,1,1,'','Re: Dear developer team: One knight\'s view of Warriors.','<t>Quote:<br/>\nI don\'t want to attack anyone here, but I\'ve seen Warriors swinging SoZ and something comparable holding agro pretty fine (assuming they and their groups belong to the most skilled players then), I\'ve seen Warriors with EB - one or two - suck.

Also, please READ my posts and try to understand them before responding. I specifically stated that the purpose of Enraging Blow is to maintain aggro, NOT to generate it initially. Maintaining it isn\'t the issue with warriors, it\'s the initial obtaining of it. If you think that enraging blow helps with this aside from a lucky proc at the outset of a fight, then you need to go back and talk to all those guildies with EB and ask them.

The 3 tank classes have 2 different focusses, Knights are chosen for their superior taunt skills, Warriors are chosen (or should be) for their superior skills in taking hits - because it\'s worth to wait for them to establish agro, and to let him have the agro (i.e. watch own a bit more).<br/>\n<br/>\nQuote:<br/>\nYou\'re actually telling warriors here, who use these things, how they work based on what you\'ve seen once or twice?Please tell me you\'re joking.<br/>\n<br/>\nNo I an NOT joking. Those Warriors also (partly) told me that they are in guilds in/post VT, i.e. in the same tier of guilds I am in, an Warriors really don\'t have any problems. Their Dex and haste is so high that the proc goes of quite often and quite fast, visible, and if not for once the Debuffers are good enough to take the few hits it takes for the Warrior to regain agro.<br/>\n<br/>\nQuote:<br/>\nHmm, but you know what, since we\'re going down that path already... Paladins shouldn\'t have any problems controlling their mana. I\'ve seen some paladins who managed to be MT\'s in their group, and serve as backup healers, and serve as CC in their group without ever medding.<br/>\n<br/>\nHmm, this part of the paragraph actually isn\'t bullshit, with an Enchanter, Bard and Beast Lord... No, but serious: You stated above an example for a Paladin played to its best, contributing with all his toys. \"contributing with all his toys\" is what people want to do, what they consider fun. That is why they tend to choose Knights OVER Warriors at the moment, at least over non-EB-Warriors. That is why Warriors need something for before they have EB to establish this agro a bit faster, and for when they have EB to make it worth in the eyes of their groups to still give them a bit more time to establish it, i.e. better Mitigation.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell actually, someone mentioned playermade Hate-proc arrows... god, procs aren\'t relyable as you yourself say, so why not - if you consider it enough for balance...<br/>\n<br/>\nQuote:<br/>\nNow, please explain to me in detail, how the fact that I could theoretically MT for a raid better than a Paladin or a Shadow Knight because I have defensive available means that the rest of the time I play the game I\'m deserving of having little or no control aggro control while Knights up and down the spectrum aren\'t challenged in this regard what so ever.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou don\'t usually tank better on a raid because of defensive, but because you have more HP/AC/Mitig./Avoid., maybe are a big class so you cannot be stunned from front AND you have defensive up for emergencies against raid-trashyard mobs or for sure against boss mobs, reducing the needed heals by far.<br/>\n\"Little or no control agro control\" I don\'t know how said that, but it wasn\'t me for sure, my intention here is to GET needed (but balanced) upgrades for Warriors, and honestly, procs still happen often enough, else they need to be tuned up, by dex, haste, or programcode.<br/>\n<br/>\nQuote:<br/>\nHaving aggro control be inherant to the WEAPON and not the CLASS means that those who can\'t get the best weapons are doomed to inferior aggro control.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat is the basic problem in EQ, much depends on items and one has to factor them into the equitation when talking about class skills, innate or AA-based. If one talks about Clerics and their powerfull rezzing, one always talks about epic Clerics. It usually is just a matter of time for them to get it, or a matter of friends and guilds they have / are in, or switch to because they want it.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor PoP it is the exact same, if you want to go to higher tier planes, you must have certain gear. It is also for all three tank classes the same, except that it would be very helpfull if Warriors had certain weapons when going there. For example, a Knight in full Thurg armor and bad jewelry in the other slots will have a hard time tanking in PoS, while a Warrior in that stage usually still has a HP advantage, needing only certain weapons to be able to outtaunt the other groupmembers, who may be from his guild (i.e. don\'t have uber weapons or high impact spells with tons of more agro yet) or from the local uber guild (with spells that crit for over 5k, weapons with ungodly ratios and procs).<br/>\nFor that point Warriors, and surely also other pure melees, are most dependant of gear. And you also partly suggest items to balance you: hate-proc arrows, that is even a solution Knights can use.<br/>\n<br/>\nLet me repeat: I have the opinion that Warriors need something for taunt, I am not the opinion that it should be innate as it would be too powerfull if stacking with EB, or would have to be too small if introduced with EB in mind. Further I am not the opinion that everyone should be able to go everywhere, in some spots one needs a certain tier of guild, certain advantage in gear to succeed, but it is not bearable that Warriors are chosen for xp groups in those places over Knights (and vice versa). For planes above PoV/S one really should have at least SS quest or comparable gear, that is why I suggested to put the gear that should balance Warriors on mobs like Vindi, Gore and such, because guilds that hunt in HoT can take them usually, and thus get those weapons for their Warriors.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, by the way, one also could rebuild the EB weapons to be clickable with the proc having a recast time of 15 seconds, so Warriors would have a garantueed (sp?) agro in the beginning of the fight. Or one could introduce proc-focus items, with proc efficiency, proc-haste, ... all item based balance tries, but well...<br/>\n<br/>\nShay</t>','518eb4976ca826efb4da6046041ac940',0,'','1li1m7to',1,0,'',0,0,0,1,0,'',0),(1353,195,3,52,0,'198.86.16.250',1506692551,0,1,1,1,1,'','Re: Dear developer team: One knight\'s view of Warriors.','<t>Aggrocontrol has 2 parts.<br/>\n1.

It helps in agro maintenance and helps in establishment ONLY when it procs often. Sorry, but waiting for a proc doesn\'t cut it for established taunt. Imo, the following would be a good upgrade for warriors (this was actually suggested by an SK on another thread):<br/>\n<br/>\n- another taunt button, 30-60second reuse that gives a warrior about 300-500 points of agro, or moves them 3-5 spots up on the agro list. This should place them on top of the list temporarily, and allow us to use other methods to maintain this agro. This wouldn\'t be a game=breaking ability simply because you can\'t mash the button, so you would have to choose when to use it. Agro establishment has been a crutch warrior problem since lvl 1, it\'s about time to fix it.<br/>\n<br/>\n- (Not as important) Remove /disc defensive nad put us on separate mitigation tables; 10-15% more than any other class. Since knights seem to stand by this unproven illusion that warriors tank so much better than them, it may as well be true. Furthermore, since others think /disc defensive actually is a good disc, then they should be overjoyed that we will no longer have the ability to lower our mitigated damage by 25%. Furthermore, we\'ve got tons of discs that people claim make warriors useful, yet we cannot use them because we need to keep defensive up pretty much always.

Irregardless of what the current status is, knights are innately a hybrid class. Every knight started out as a hybrid, your spells up to level 60 are generally hand-me-downs from clerics. Because no knight started a character at level 61, you are nevertheless hybrids. Granted, rangers, beastlords, paladins and Shadowknight (won\'t group bards here because they\'ve always been a unique class) develop into a separate entity, and I am all for that, but the knight core is still derived from hybrid ideology. However, this isn\'t the subject of this discussion, so let\'s stay on focus.<br/>\n<br/>\nI will agree with you that diminished capabilities of 2 classes don\'t completely make an effective third class. Understand, as you and quite a few of the hybrids that have come here to debte us, that no respectable opinion presented here is calling for a return to RoK/early SoV status. This simply isn\'t the case. What we are debating is our deficiency in tanking compared to your class, considering what additional boons your class has that ours lacks.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe argue for upgrades in relation to knights from beyond the parent/hybrid perspective, but rather from a tank vs. tank perspective. As you say, it all boils down to the fact that both are tanks. We are basing our claims on a simple notion, how is it just that a tank vs. a tank with spells share equal prowess in tanking ability, much less that hte tank with spells actually holds superiority over the pure tank.<br/>\nWilhelmm D\'averam<br/>\nOverlord of the Apocalypse<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat does lurk inside the Rabbit Hole?</t>','e8343d7fe938fdcd44dedc944383d49a',0,'','1z51r5pz',1,0,'',0,0,0,1,0,'',0),(1387,195,3,52,0,'198.86.16.250',1506692874,0,1,1,1,1,'','Re: Dear developer team: One knight\'s view of Warriors.','<r>Quote:<br/>\nThe fault in comparing druids and wizards to warriors and knights is that knights are not pure classes, they are hybrid.

Does a druid in SS gear nuke better than a ranger? That is a valid comparison of a hybrid/parent balance of power.<br/>\n<br/>\nNO, that is not a valid comparison. If you go into the old stereotypes, then do it right: The hybrids were - intended, but not really - 75% Melee, 25% Caster, and of course a pure class about one task is far better than a 25% class in that task. In the case of Paladins we are 20% Clerics now, not really more when factoring in all the skills we share of them and the usual manapool. Up to a certain point we also are 80% Warriors in equal gear, this difference diminishes in late VT stage, thus needs to be fixed then (if elemental armor doesn\'t do the job).<br/>\nIn addition to that Warrior taunt needs to be adjusted, it didn\'t grow with the PoP agro increasing changes to most other classes and twinking guns, but it must, purely that Warriors can have more fun again, and that other classes in their groups can have fun with them as well. EB though, even if it only procs randomly (swing increasing AAs and Dex should help a lot, maybe go for that instead of LR 500), does a lot already, a group can go into a fight far earlier, not as early as with Knights though...<br/>\n<br/>\nSomeone asked earlier \"why would someone create a Warrior today\" and I think I can answer that: If he creates a new account, not knowing much about the game or being a PLed supertwink who is supposed to be 65 in 2 months, a Warrior is very appealing. You have decent HP (up until you can hunt in NToV or later with your guild at least when comparing) and are the best tank even if there are some that have slight advantages taunting. You are the base for DPS of classes, yes Monks, Rangers, Rogues and the most casters are higher, but Bards and Knights are inferior. You don\'t need to care about mana or buy spells.<br/>\nThe twinking game blurs the lines a lot, classes get huge taunt, DPS and lots more AC/HP with twink gear, there are twinks of players that didn\'t seem to at least watch the mains of their twinkclass a bit, behave like their mains in the twinkhunt zone (i.e. they don\'t respect the zone that may be tough for them or their group), and are complete nerds as their class. For Warriors that means that even in the lower level game, many people don\'t watch their agro. As I said, I have a Warrior as well, and I see that I lose agro when a Ranger casts all his spells right from the start or an Enchanter tashes before the pulled mob is even in camp - on the other side my twink can go to a zone with her gear my main would never have dared to at the same level (KC with a group 40-47 anyone?).<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen people get into PoP stage latest, Warriors really, really need to grow back a bit closer with their taunting compared to the other classes\' agro generation, suggestions summarized on page 18, hehe...<br/>\n<br/>\nShay<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S.: Thank you for your post, Wilhelmm, that was really a pleasure to read, if only more would discuss in that tone... <E>:)</E></r>','4659f9443ccfd11d8713a95c2de37f7c',0,'','36q970u0',1,0,'',0,0,0,1,0,'',0),(1388,195,3,52,0,'198.86.16.250',1506692884,0,1,1,1,1,'','Re: Dear developer team: One knight\'s view of Warriors.','<t>Quote:<br/>\nWe are basing our claims on a simple notion, how is it just that a tank vs. a tank with spells share equal prowess in tanking ability, much less that hte tank with spells actually holds superiority over the pure tank.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn taking damage the tank with spells doesn\'t hold superiority, only in taunting. Only point is that the difference in taking dmg gets smaller and smaller as a guild proceeds in tiers post-SoL, while the advantage in taunt only goes down to a far lower degree (i.e. the Warrior goes from none over low-agro procing weapons to one to two EB-weapons and higher dex, haste, ... all that reduces the taunt-difference, Knights mainly rely on their spells from start to end for taunt).<br/>\nStill though, Knights are tanks, they compete for the same spot in groups as Warriors do, thus need a similar overall efficiency there - this seems to be not the case at the moment (in the often stated tiers of games and areas as taunt and mitigation) in favor of the Knights, this is the reason for this thread.<br/>\n<br/>\nMany Warriors seem to have the opinion though that because Knights have spells they need to be the worse overall tanks. From the other side one could argue (read and forget please, no need to comment since it is nobody\'s opinion): \"Knights need to be better overall tanks because they have the curse of having to / are powerfull enough to use mana/spells. Casting classes at higher level have always been mightier than melees in most RPGs.\"<br/>\nMy opinion is that spell enabled tanks should be as efficient as the pure tank afterall, not more, not less.

From the other side one could argue (read and forget please, no need to comment since it is nobody\'s opinion): \"Knights need to be better overall tanks because they have the curse of having to / are powerfull enough to use mana/spells. Casting classes at higher level have always been mightier than melees in most RPGs.\"<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nShay, you\'re missing a couple of key points to the current arguement. While you can attempt with some justification to say that when a Warrior and a Knight in equal gear and with AAXP are standing side by side being beat on by identical mobs that the Warrior will take damage better (I would say slightly better, you would probably say significantly better) than the Knight, that really is not the issue.<br/>\n<br/>\nPoP has made the consequences for losing control of the mob\'s attention so detrimental that being able to take damage better is meaningless if you can\'t also hold the mob\'s attention. One heal on one other member of the party eats up as much mana as a complete heal. Having to heal additional party members beyond the tank is asking for the situation to get out of control. And frankly, most people want to be able to play their character without constantly worrying about getting the beat down.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith a Warrior you always have the risk of being right on the edge of drawing aggro. Some people can play that way and are perfectly comfortable. Others dislike having to be that careful all the time. Others still just aren\'t able to do it. Those who think Warriors are fine insist we must only play with the first group. Because the second and third group are unlikely to want us.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith a Knight on the other hand, all three groups would be perfectly happy, even though he may be the inferior tank over all. The situation is more in control. The reactions of the mobs are more predictable. The contributions from the other group mates are more wide open. The group as a whole is much more effective. He can have significantly less HP and AC and still be preferred because he holds aggro that much better.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis completely offsets any additional DPS or tanking advantage the Warrior may have. The DPS advantage does not matter. The tanking advantages does not matter. The only thing that matters is what allows the group as a whole to participate more, have more feelings of accomplishment, and succeed more frequently. These days this is not the Warrior in by far the majority of the situations.<br/>\n<br/>\nAllowing Warriors better aggro control, better than their current, not better than a Knight\'s, will put Warriors back in the game. If a group can feel reasonably comfortable that they can do their jobs without constantly being on the edge of death then they\'ll be happier. Even if the Warrior holds aggro better than currently, this won\'t spell the demise of the Knight class. The Knights are in better shape overall than they have been in any other period of the game. They won\'t suddenly become unwelcome because Warriors can suddenly be effective. The Knights will still have the versatilty of their spells, which the Warriors will never match. It will become a choice between two tank types that can both do the job, one that takes a beating better and one that takes a beating well enough but brings other things to the situation.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis change should not be tied to items. Tying things to items just means that only those people who gain the items have the fix. LoH isn\'t tied to items. Stun isn\'t tied to items. Stop trying to tie Warrior corrections to items. We are already hosed enough in the limited selection of weapons we can use that may actually viably hold aggro.<br/>\nThe Man in Black: We are men of action, lies do not become us.</t>','ade7200eeb77e53d2d2d53b2c3a9172e',0,'','9a4kustt',1,0,'',0,0,0,1,0,'',0),(1403,195,3,52,0,'198.86.16.250',1506949034,0,1,1,1,1,'','Re: Dear developer team: One knight\'s view of Warriors.','<r>after a few hours of ltg i was asked to play my cleric in PoV one of the best exp groups i have been fortunate to have in weeks all 9 hours of it the Tank? was a monk<br/>\n<br/>\nand we had a sk for back up in case of multiple pulls warriors need not apply.<br/>\n<br/>\nif i could only get a group for 9 hours on my warrior id be a happy gnome<br/>\n<br/>\nbtw thanks stinky <E>:)</E><br/>\nOrchid and Cascia are my personal Goddess but I\'ll share<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n.....

People in thurgadin or lower type gear. <br/>\n<br/>\nYou don\'t really see paladins tanking in KC or Ot or Loio. The reason is because until you hit a certain point with gear, the agro you get will kill you. Warriors are clearly the superior tanks, no matter how much agro a paladin can generate.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMove forward to pop and the gear level at that point. You start hitting softcaps on AC. You start getting all/all 100hp items. That means the stats can close or not mean as much as they did. Add in the fact that pop mobs hit HARD for their level. You have to control agro from the start or squishies get dead. The reason there is so much agro at the start is because mobs hit so hard, you have to slow. Without slow your tanks will die. So fast slow equals high agro equals dead squishies if someone can\'t get agro off them fast.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn velks, you wanted warriors to tank because if they slipped on agro it meant someone might lose a little health. You killed mobs fast though and you had to make sure that CH\'s were efficient. You had plenty of time to cast them usually, but you wanted all your mana to be max efficiency. This meant you took a warrior as tank as much, if not more, then a paladin. Agro was not as big of a factor as max hp/ac was.<br/>\n<br/>\nPop on the other hand is all about agro. Lose it and people die... fast. Paladins have not gotten anything new to make them better tanks. The only change was that you had to hold agro start to finish or else casters died. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe increase in damage was done to elminate soloing. You are now forced to group. The side effect is that high agro classes are now your tanks. You put the best high agro tank in as MT. For the first time ever, knights are the best at something. Sure, it\'s less efficient then using a warrior, but since it\'s more efficient to have live group members as opposed to dead ones, you make do.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can eliminate this problem by toning down dmg dealt by mobs. Now you don\'t have to worry about getting that fast agro becuase slow can come later in the fight. You could increase the amount of hate a warrior does when he hits the taunt button. You can add a +hate modifier to arrows. These will allow warriors to gain agro faster and resume the spot as the best main tank. You could nerf the agro from paladin spells and make it so no one has fast agro.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI\'d prefer to see warriors get a taunt upgrade. This will kick paladins out of MT slots though. This is bad because most groups don\'t fight in areas where you need rapid crowd control. If you don\'t need someone to protect a group then there is no need for a paladin. <br/>\n<br/>\nHow do you fix it though? Give one class preference in tanking and the other class pretty much is out of job. Neither class has the ability to turn up dps when not tanking. If we coudl do that then we could fill a dps slot, but that would put even more classes out of a job.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne way to fix the new problem is to make a zone with really freaking good exp.

You are \"specialist in pure tanking\" which means that you are best in pure tanking. That means you are best in tanking (here: the combination of taunting and taking dmg) without own manasupport - and that is still the case, even though it isn\'t sufficient anymore. On raids (and yes, Defensive MUST be factored in, no matter how old it is, some here even mention our spells which come from original EQ, not Kunark, i.e. are even older and also factored in), you still are the best tank. You are most geardependant of all melees I guess since you must get defensive gear, offensive dps weapons for when you don\'t MT/ST/TT/... AND agro weapons to offset the agro enhancing class skills expansion by expansion, which the others get more easily or even innate.<br/>\nAgain: When comparing a Warrior to an OOM or silences Knight you are clearly superior - throughout the game and all its tiers (when equally geared). Thus you ARE the \"without question best class for the job\".<br/>\n<br/>\nBut: When you count in mana into the game, this desire doesn\'t stand its ground anymore, mustn\'t stand its ground anymore. I do not even want that this mana makes all tanks equally strong in all situations, I just ask for groups, and THAT is what I want Warriors like you and the others to accept, that we all get EQUAL chances for groups while you still stay best raid tanks for the central foes (who cares who actually offtanks, in a time where a Druid can tank Statue it\'s relative anyways).<br/>\nI mean, come on, I ask for you getting the upgrades to not slip into the dust, and you reply CLEARLY that Knights shall land just there... or what do you think would happen if Warriors are the best tanks in all situations again?

That doesn\'t seem to have changed with later zones and the upgearing required to reach them. <br/>\n<br/>\nSmall point, if mobs do damage enough to make it difficult for a Knight to offtank then the warrior is going to need a heal also within the next few seconds - would you as a healer want to gamble on my having swung/proc\'ed enough to ensure that mob doesn\'t hit you? The slower\'s gotta be a little unhappy with the possibility that he shouldn\'t slow the mob (rendering it massively less damaging) when there\'s a good chance if he does it too fast it\'ll pong onto him.....<br/>\n<br/>\nI don\'t see paladins going oom much when they main tank in exp groups so I don\'t consider your comparison of my class to yours when you don\'t have access to class defining abilities to be relevant.

The problem is that anything less than parity with you in taunt will still leave me LFG - why would a slower or cleric want to deal with ANY chance of ponging when they can avoid it with a knight?HOWEVER as you said the moment I have parity in taunt you loose your position in the group. It seems to me to be a very binary dilemma - Warrior In/Knight LFG or Knight In/Warrior LFG.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe that means we should both avoid efficiency based groups like the plague (although i still think you\'re avoiding the point that the minute there is one tank of any class in a group another warrior is pretty much redundant, not so with a knight unless \'efficiency\' is all you\'re interested in). <br/>\n<br/>\nDon\'t forget I\'m a human being too, everytime the RNG screws me about I feel inadequate at my job.

On the SK side, what do you get? Subpar DPS, some group taps (with SKs only having one somewhat nice tap?) that don\'t really grant a visible effect, one less to rez when the group wipes because 2 FD\'ed.

Tanking is taking dmg and making the mob hurt you (else you couldn\'t take dmg :p ). There is a tendency in progress at the moment away from Warriors because in 95%+ of the cases the slower (that needs to slow fast in PoP) gets beaten, and other classes get agro far to easy to fully live their role (as Healer, DPS machine, ...) with Warriors tanking.<br/>\nWhile many Warriors here pointed out that with EB it is ok to maintain agro, there needs something to get some relative secure agro at the start of the fight, like the (from a Warrior) mentioned AA skill to get a button to add about 500 hate once every minute, or the hate procing playermade arrows, or whatever in that line. Seeing that in HoT/NToV era of the game the Warriors still have a big enough advantage in HP and other defensive skills (by AA, AC whatever), it would be well worth for people to let the best tank build some agro, or work a bit harder to let him hold it (\"work harder\" compared to how they have with Knights).<br/>\nPeople have no problem with single hits or even deaths, it happens to Knights as well, e.g. if a mob pops on a pulling Knight, he brings it back to camp without having much chance to build his innitial agro, the Slower slows like he used to all the time: at once - and gets instant agro. People just don\'t want to get hit every time, they want to see that them watching their agro helps (and I don\'t mean staying out of battle until the mob is at less than 50%, or 80 to 60% with EB depending on the proc rate). <br/>\n<br/>\nSo a small taunt upgrade would balance the tank classes sufficiently (since Furor passed 10k HP lately, I am not really sure anymore if Warriors need a Mitigation upgrade, I never saw a Knight getting close to even 9k HP) since it wouldn\'t come to a class that has no other advantages, you have better def skills (yes, to a low degree), more HP/AC, mostly more defensive focused AA sets, higher DPS, there is a lot that makes you attractive to a group.<br/>\n<br/>\nShay</t>','a7226970d853d493ad300f9ba19b7609',0,'','ipvvjdy9',1,0,'',0,0,0,1,0,'',0),(1426,195,3,52,0,'198.86.16.250',1506949302,0,1,1,1,1,'','Re: Dear developer team: One knight\'s view of Warriors.','<t>No pal/sk is much over 9k due to the fact that FoH and similar guilds will be gearing up their MT\'s first.<br/>\n<br/>\nLook at Furor\'rs Profile...

And that means the guild is post-VT and post VT means they are / will be soon in Elemental gear, and Furor is in the exactly that stage of the game, and he is an example for the most/best geared Warriors. There is only a comparable clad Knight missing to really compare.<br/>\n<br/>\nImagine a Warrior and a Knight being clad in all the same gear, same weapon (e.g. Blade of War) and both full Elemental Armor. If the difference then is lower than, lets say, 1500 HP / 200 AC the Mitigation upgrade is really needed, if Warriors exceed Knight by 2000 HP / 300 AC, it\'s not needed necessarily.<br/>\nFor the HoT and maybe NToV stage of the game, this upgrade is clearly not needed at all since the Warrior class (if comparable geared to the same stage\'s Knights) exceeds them by the postulated 20% still anyways.<br/>\nAnd what if one only factors in the average representants of a class for balance issues if the measurements could entirely break the highend game thereafter? <br/>\n<br/>\nA Warrior asking for defensive upgrades in HoT/NToV stage either is undergeared, compares himself to a relatively better geared Knight or is just greedy for more percentage points when looking at the chance of tanks being chosen for a group. A Warrior asking for the same taunt skills as a Knight is comparable with a Druid asking for CHeal (the 7500 HP for 400 mana one), a Cleric asking for Druid-like nukes or a Knight asking for the defensive skills (incl. HP/AC/Mitig./Avoid. and all other def. skills) of a Warrior.<br/>\nI\'ll say it again: If a Knight is chosen for a pickup xp group, he is chosen to tank for them, he is not chosen for his other skills (though atm maybe for his tank AND other skills, but \"tank\" remains central). His other skills, with maybe the exception of the FD ability of SKs, are not sufficiently strong to have the Knight replace for example one of the two to three DPS dealers purposely. <br/>\n<br/>\nWarriors are the specialists of taking damage, thus need high HP/AC (and all the other stuff I always list in this context :p ) at a visible advantage to other classes. Knights are the specialists for taunt. The situation at the moment though shows itself as Warriors that Warriors at a certain stage lose the advantage of taking damage better than others from others closing in too far (which is derived from the all/all gear) and that - up until a certain gear level - their taunt doesn\'t grow enough with the other classes hate producing upgrades (like DPS, slows, heals, many of which got their hate component altered and changed over and over or outgrew standard taunt expansion by expansion).<br/>\nAll the time people had to wait for Warriors to build a bit head-up agro while Knights (or hybrids in general) got it quite fast, so there would be no justification for asking equal skills in taunting (and I am not implying that anyone does).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe taunt and mitigation upgrade should, in my opinion work like this: When in an xp group a mob is incomming, the Warrior needs a bit time to build some agro, until he has built a certain ammount and the others can step in fully. This building process should not take longer than 5 to 8 seconds. The HP/Mitigation advantage needs to ensure that the group isn\'t less efficient during the evening derived from the average maybe 5 seconds later landing slow.<br/>\nFor Knights it is exactly vice-versa: The slow can land lower and thus set off the lesser HP/Mitigation.<br/>\nFor the other skills a Knight has and mostly shines with on raids, the Warrior clearly needs some skills (by AA or whatever) that grand them a role if no real MT rotation is needed - but that would be needed for classes like Shamans, Enchanters and such as well, so it\'s doubtfull that this would come - just to be realistic without saying that I don\'t would love to see you having more fun...<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, and I think we are over the time where a group of specialists could do everything better than a versatlity class group.<br/>\n<br/>\nShay</t>','157b8ec523b428ffe079e3e02128ef1a',0,'','1s8l9xvj',1,0,'',0,0,0,1,0,'',0),(1430,195,3,52,0,'198.86.16.250',1506949342,0,1,1,1,1,'','Re: Dear developer team: One knight\'s view of Warriors.','<t>Quote:<br/>\nOh, and I think we are over the time where a group of specialists could do everything better than a versatlity class group.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWe are?

Where do these myths about Enraging Blow weapons come from, I just have to know. Let me once again clarify this point that so many hybrids have been missing. EB weapons do NOT solve the problems of initiating agro, the crux problem facing warriors today. Please, do not try to educate us on how these weapons work, there are quite a few people here that use them and can provide far more accurate descriptions.<br/>\n<br/>\nEB is great for agro MAINTENANCE. If you notice, as I\'ve mentioned earlier, our problem is establishment, not maintenance. Even if an EB weapon luckily procs quickly, and the warrior is taunting, even this is not guaranteed agro. The whole point of effectively establishing agro is that you can establish whenever necessary, not when game design allows your weapon to proc. Agro establishment CANNOT be based on such inconsistent concepts as weapon proc. <br/>\n<br/>\nMaintenance, absolutely. EB weapons work beautifully here. Usually when it procs, it tremdously aids getting agro. Howeve, by no means it is guaranteed, and it remains a risky factor. Therefore, when you classify the warrior agro-control issues, please do not assume that the post-EB category has flawless taunt; this is far from the case. BOTH categories suffer from a severe lack of snap agro, and this is the issue a lot of warriors are pushing to be addressed.<br/>\n<br/>\nWilhelmm D\'averam<br/>\nOverlord of the Apocalypse<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat does lurk inside the Rabbit Hole?</t>','155d021350e26c6d697b92351d64b780',0,'','156kx3vg',1,0,'',0,0,0,1,0,'',0),(1438,195,3,52,0,'198.86.16.250',1506949399,0,1,1,1,1,'','Re: Dear developer team: One knight\'s view of Warriors.','<t>Quote:<br/>\nAh, the EB misconceptions continue.<br/>\n<br/>\nNot for me /shrug I got your point already.

I was thinking that if it was a large amount then there would be at least a little \"down time\" so to speak. If I am correct though stun is only 35 mana, which is about two ticks standing mana regen with KEI and a point of FT isn\'t it? Hrm, no that would be 30 mana well about the same.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo skill could cost you as much yellow bar as Acumen takes two or three ticks to regen? Also, on it\'s own it usually doesn\'t regen mid combat (for me at least, well not that I notice anyway, usually ask for acumen anyway) so the main idea was to limit per combat use to roughly equal to stun, or slightly less. Putting it at two/three acumen ticks would limit it\'s use to as infinate as that of an equally buffed paladin (basically). Or just setting the refresh timer at 18 seconds (3 ticks) but I would prefer a shorter refresh and longer regen of yellow bar. That way if something bad happened you could use it again and recover yellow bar as needed later.<br/>\n<br/>\nI donno, it was just an idea I wanted to throw out.<br/>\n<br/>\nTaunt haste would be interesting, but I think it isn\'t necessarily what a lot of the warriors are looking for?

You know you can generate more aggro than the warrior so the slower won\'t be attacked when slow hits. You\'re both around the same level, and while the warrior can tank the mob better you know it will help the group if you tank so the slower doesn\'t die every 10 minutes or so. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe warrior knows he has a problem with aggro in the beginning of a fight, where he hasn\'t had the time to generate aggro but during which part slow has to hit. He\'s annoyed with Verant, PoP, his class and life in general. This warrior is a guildmember, a nice guy, and you know you don\'t want him to quit cause else you get to tank Vindicator on the next raid. What do you do?<br/>\n<br/>\nI don\'t know if you\'ve ever asked a warrior \"hey, mind if i tank?\" in group. In my experience, no selfrespecting warrior wants you to tank instead of him because it makes him feel useless. No warrior wants to be a dps in the group. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHow to give a warrior the hate he needs<br/>\n----------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nA warrior\'s main problem with taunting happens right in the beginning of the fight, where the slower suddenly sees his hate spike above the amount of hate the warrior has had the chance to generate. Once the warrior takes aggro back from the slower, the fight usually goes fine. The problem is, you may end up with a dead slower in the beginning of the fight.<br/>\n<br/>\nWarriors can generate steady hate over time with weapon damage and procs. They can\'t generate bursts of hate, whereas a shadowknight can. I usually use clinging darkness for this purpose, leaving the newer hate spells unmemmed. In order to help the warrior, you need to know the following:<br/>\n<br/>\n1) One cast of clinging darkness generates more hate than one cast of slow. If the slower has to cast slow again (resist), the 2nd slow will make the mob jump the slower unless you have cast clinging darkness a second time. For simplicity\'s sake, let\'s assume that:<br/>\n<br/>\n- clinging darkness: 400 hate<br/>\n- resisted slow: 350 hate<br/>\n- successful slow: 300 hate<br/>\n<br/>\n2) A spell will generate hate whether it sticks or not. It will even generate hate if the creature is immune to that spell. From the slower\'s part, a resisted slow generates a little more hate than a successful slow. A shadowknight can keep his hate over the slower\'s hate if he casts clinging darkness at least as many times as the slower has to cast slow. I generally pull a mob by casting clinging darkness on it twice, this gives the slower a margin for two resisted slows (where i have 800 hate, and the shaman 700 hate). If i don\'t cast clinging darkness a third time before the slower casts his third slow attempt, the slower\'s hate will exceed mine and he will be attacked. Usually slow will hit on the first or second try. <br/>\n<br/>\n3) During the time when the shadowknight is casting hate spells to keep his hate above that of the shaman, the warrior will be hitting the mob to gain aggro. A shadowknight can cast Voice of Terris on the warrior, which will let the warrior generate 10% more hate. This is still not enough to avoid the slower being jumped on slow, but it is used later on.<br/>\n<br/>\n4) A successful taunt from the warrior gives the warrior an amount of hate equal to whatever the highest guy on the hate list has +1. You may have seen this in action when you\'re the tank, you have a warrior in the group, and the mobs suddenly pingpongs between you and the warrior even when you\'re chain casting darkness and you know the warrior has no possible way to generate as much hate as you do. That\'s a successful taunt attempt.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHow to put it together<br/>\nEither the shadowknight pulls, or he casts clinging darkness on the mob when it is being brought in by the puller. I prefer to be the puller cause it gives me more time to cast clinging on the mob. Ideally i will be casting clinging darkness on the mob 4 times regardless of who is the puller. This will give me 1600 hate, taken the numbers from my example.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe slower can cast slow at his leasure if i have 1600 hate. On successful slow he\'s at 300 hate, on resist + success he\'s at 650 hate, even with 2 resists he\'ll be at 1000 hate when slow finally hits. This is quite safe for the slower. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn the meantime, the warrior is taunting. He will have a successful taunt either before or after slow hits. If he can\'t taunt the mob off you before slow hits, the slower is casting against your 1600 hate and nothing can happen. If the warrior taunts the mob off you before the slow hits, the slower is casting against the warrior\'s 1601 hate, which is still completely safe. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen you see the mob switch from you to the warrior, this is the point where the warrior just received hate 1 point above yours. The mob may pingpong between you and the warrior for a moment. This means the warrior got 1 point over your hate, but you hit the mob so it ponged back to you. In both cases, switch off autoattack to let the warrior outtaunt you for a few seconds. Don\'t switch off autoattack before this happens, the more aggro you have at the point when the warrior takes over the better. The mob may switch very early during the fight, it totally depends on how early the warrior gets a successful taunt. Your hate may be sky high, the warrior simply gets what you have +1. After giving the warrior a few seconds, switch autoattack on again.<br/>\n<br/>\nBecause you generated so much hate in the beginning, the warrior now has a huge amount of hate as well. Nobody but you can pull the mob off the warrior for the rest of the fight unless you have some huge nukers in your party, so all you have to do is be careful with your own hate from this point on. I\'ve never seen the mob get off a warrior after i cast clinging darkness 4 times and the warrior took over, and i don\'t get aggro back if i just autoattack and cast the occasional spear. You will want to cast Voice of Terris on the warrior so you can stay under the warrior\'s hate better. If the warrior can\'t keep aggro with Voice of Terris on him after he\'s taken over your hate and all you\'re doing is autoattack, you need a different warrior.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWhere does Feign Death fit in all this?<br/>\nYou may be tempted to use Feign Death. The situation where you definately shouldn\'t FD is right after you pulled a mob to the warrior. I\'ve seen shadowknights run the mob to the warrior and FD in front of him like monks do, to make the mob aggro the warrior. Sure, this works, but the warrior gets the mob with minimum hate and you can be certain your slower is going to get hit. Your job is to make the warrior start out with as much hate as you can, not the 0 hate from a freshly pulled mob. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn my example, you may want to FD after the warrior\'s taunt gave him 1601 hate and you still have 1600 hate. In my experience, switching attack off for 2 seconds is enough to give the warrior a head start, and unless you completely overdo it you\'re not going to catch up with him anymore. I find it useful to keep myself on 2nd highest aggro in case the warrior loses aggro (eg. if he dies). <br/>\n<br/>\nShould you be forced to FD before the warrior has taken over your aggro (you are after all tanking the mob during the period when it\'s unslowed most of the time), the warrior will have to generate aggro by himself. But don\'t die for him, after all, you are still a shadowknight.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________<br/>\nSamaell Eternal<br/>\n65 Ogre Dread Lord<br/>\nXanadu, Tallon Zek<br/>\n<br/>\nMy Magelo Profile</t>','7ce91aba006d538bcca7d0e99311947f',0,'','36fafpf2',1,0,'',0,0,0,1,0,'',0),(1465,269,3,52,0,'198.86.16.250',1506949901,0,1,1,1,1,'','Re: i know this has been gone over alot of times but look anyway','<t>Or, better yet, the SK keeps tanking, cause he\'s perfectly capable of it, and you get a rogue, wizard, mage, beastlord, or anyone else who actually does damage and you get more experience per hour.<br/>\n<br/>\nLook, everyone knows how aggro transfer works, it\'s an awesome idea, and it\'d be GREAT, except that the current mitigation difference is so small between warriors and shadowknights that it\'s not necessary or required, and a group is sincerely BETTER off with the SK just going ahead and tanking.</t>','bf370f7cb32bce39c6f3051c23d47869',0,'','1a1an8ha',1,0,'',0,0,0,1,0,'',0),(1466,270,3,52,0,'198.86.16.250',1506949924,0,1,1,1,1,'','EQOA warrior skills and *coughs* spells','<t>TAGS : None<br/>\n<br/>\nSeems fer dis EQOA dey has da concept o\'differen levels o\'taunt among odder thins.

And like you said I was taking this game too seriously (although this game is practically catered for that as the high end seeing requires so much effort just to get there, and I mean 60+ high end not Ntov+ high end). As far as I was concerned I was done with EQ.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThen I started playing my Shaman again, and realised all the fun I had forgotten about. Loot is not required, its nice but a distant secondary priority. I am more wanted in groups (far less shaman than tanks (especially warriors) on my server), I can do a shitload more, and I can solo well. Sure some of my spells are pretty damn hard to get, but nowhere near BOC hard. I am far more care free, relaxed, and I love buffing strangers when they pass by. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nDamn you Sony/VI, I was almost out lol. Oh well at least I have a 65 meatshield if anyone needs him for something i guess, and I met a great guild through him. But other than that I have no regrets quiting him.

With the money from a green scale, you might be able to buy 2 Fleshgrinders, but the 1hs epic is better than dual Fleshgrinders.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe epic has 100 dd, 500 hate, 30 attack (at least), 55 dex, 12 AC (plus stats and a solid offhand ratio) -- I don\'t think you can buy anything in the bazaar for the price of a green scale that gets you anything that good. The 2hs epic packs a 175 dd and 500 hate. How many hate proccing 2handers are there in the game? How many things can you buy give you the option to do BOTH 1hs and 2hs, each with hate procs?<br/>\n<br/>\nBy the way, I am totally convinced that that when the epic proc is resisted, the DD portion is, but NOT the hate portion. Time and time again I see a notice that my proc is resisted, but the mob turns right around on me anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe epic needs more respect, imho. Yes, you can buy stuff with better dps, but you will be a worse tank.</t>','c25c1adf5edbfa20a88456936e15c39f',0,'','gxd51jo9',1,0,'',0,0,0,1,0,'',0),(1519,259,37,51,0,'68.61.123.121',1506956947,0,1,1,1,1,'','Re: Lv51 Warrior, Epic Question...','<t>Re: Lv51 Warrior, Epic Question...	  #11	[-]<br/>\n avatar<br/>\n<br/>\nPosts: 0<br/>\nMar 25 03 8:26 AM<br/>\nReply Quote More<br/>\nMy Recent Posts<br/>\nQuote:<br/>\nDont bother with working on the small pieces of your epic until you have the green scale, fear golem ball, hand of maestro, spiroc wingblade and queen blade. Once you have those you can complete your epic in a day. If you don\'t have them your wasting time and bank space.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYes or No. It depends on how your guild distributing epic pieces. I was in a guild that give out epic pieces based on Epic Progress. Therefore, Leg works are as important as bottleneck pieces coz if a green scale dropped, you are going to compete it with your fellow guildies too.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy advice. Spend ONE day to do all the leg works. There was a very good post above. Buy all the easy and relatively cheap stuffs you can afford such as<br/>\n<br/>\n- The thingy from DL\'s gaint fort (can be time sink to camp)<br/>\n- Block of Permafrost (can be time sink and many CR to camp)<br/>\n- All the gems<br/>\n- Rebreathers<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter leg works done, LEVEL &gt;&gt; ALL. I do not think a guild will give out an epic piece to a lvl51 warrior than to a lvl60 warrior. You get the idea? <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you worry about the current weapon. Let me tell you, do not bother with 1hand weapons, a GOOD one is way too expensive considering fleshgrinder is decent only but still costs something like 40k. Go with a cheap and decent 2hander (Reaver, Dismay axe). It can last you until lvl65 for exp grinding.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, do the leg works, get few more levels, participate in guild raids.</t>','d87caa14ef42ee616c674183f5825bee',0,'','v61gfvrj',1,0,'',0,0,0,1,0,'',0),(1520,275,37,51,0,'68.61.123.121',1506956965,0,1,1,1,1,'','Wood Elf War have newbie armor quest?','<t>Lead	[-]<br/>\n avatar<br/>\n<br/>\nPosts: 0<br/>\nMar 24 03 11:40 AM<br/>\nReply Quote More<br/>\nMy Recent Posts<br/>\nTAGS : None<br/>\n<br/>\nAs title?<br/>\nDidn\'t see any quest about wood elf war newbie quest.....<br/>\nhelp.............thanks<br/>\n<br/>\ne LV13 tF Fkv</t>','9bd0e891aec183c21f6e848df8cff925',0,'','l1yaq0hj',1,0,'',0,0,0,1,0,'',0),(1521,275,37,51,0,'68.61.123.121',1506956975,0,1,1,1,1,'','Re: Wood Elf War have newbie armor quest?','<t>Re: Wood Elf War have newbie armor quest?	  #1	[-]<br/>\n avatar<br/>\n<br/>\nPosts: 0<br/>\nMar 24 03 1:53 PM<br/>\nReply Quote More<br/>\nMy Recent Posts<br/>\nYes, they do.

You run around and talk to people. Instead of handing stuff in, most of the time, you\'ll merely hail them, and presumeably they\'ll check your inventory, note that you have the item, tell you to destroy it, and send you off after something else. There are a couple of items that you aren\'t instructed to destroy, however (including a lore, magic, no drop, unuseable medallion that you get from the guildmaster right at the start), and I\'m holding onto those.<br/>\nYou\'ll need a few items from mobs out in Innothule. These include-<br/>\nCracked Aquamarine - drops off of the tiny mushroom men as well as the alligators. The mushroom men are level two. The alligators are much higher.<br/>\nTroll Invader Head - I believe this will drop off of any of the trolls (except maybe Lynuga, who is still around) in the swamp. Most seem to range from roughly levels 8-10, except for Lynuga, who\'s an old pre-Gukta troll, and is much higher. Its a rare drop. The first troll I killed had one, but I haven\'t seen any drop since then.<br/>\nTongue of the Traitor - this drops off the Froglok Traitor, which seems to be a unique, albeit common, mob that spawns close to Guk. Green con at level 10. Only one I killed had the tongue, so it might always drop.<br/>\nThe reward for doing all of the tasks is a Sta +3 earring.<br/>\n<br/>\nArmor quests - the Frogloks get newbie class armor quests. The Dar Initiate armor is a very dark green color. Details on the items needed can be found in this thread at EQTraders<br/>\n<br/>\nmboards.eqtraders.com/php...php?t=4288<br/>\n<br/>\nAbout the fifth or sixth post, there\'s three or four consecutive posts, each with the full armor quest details.<br/>\nMany of the items are incredibly rare. Each item is only used for one piece of armor. The Dar armor doesn\'t use multiple pieces of ore, unlike most of the other plate armor newbie quests (the Shin paladin armor apparently does, however). My frog warrior is level 11, and has been hunting after this stuff for most of those levels. There are still over half a dozen items I simply have not seen, and most of the shouts and oocs for newbie armor components seem to be people looking for the warrior drops. One particularly annoying bit is that some of the components are from bleeders. There are roughly half a dozen different \'bleeder\' mobs in the swamp, so it helps to know exactly which bleeder you need. Here\'s where I found some of the rarer items.<br/>\n<br/>\nMalleable bleeder skin - a feral bleeder<br/>\nLarvae Carapace - tough-skinned larvae<br/>\nalligator skin - an alligator (don\'t think I\'ve seen them on bull alligators)<br/>\nSomeone told me they found a bleeder carapace (which the clerics apparently also use) on a feral bleeder, although I haven\'t seen one drop yet.<br/>\nThe kobold livers also seem to be extremely rare. I found one, and someone gave me another. Unfortunately, I don\'t remember if the liver dropped from the normal kobold or the burly kobold.<br/>\nSo far, I have not found or been given any of the following:<br/>\nPristine Moccasin Scales<br/>\nPristine Alligator Hide<br/>\nLarvae Skin<br/>\nBull Alligator Spines<br/>\n<br/>\nNote that this doesn\'t mean I\'ve found everything else. A guildmate handed me a bag with a bunch of extra items he\'d found that I was able to use.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt some point between levels 1 and 11, you can hail the High Seer, who stands on the raised platform in the middle of the guild leaders. He\'ll help you to make a \'soulstone\' (not sure, but this might be a charm), provided you collect the components for him. From the sound of his comments, this might be a multi-part job.

Suteng felt nothing but contempt for them.<br/>\nThey, of course, were weaker then, or at least so he [thought].<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;What is thought?<br/>\n<br/>\nWithout a second thought, Suteng stabbed the ogre nearest to him in the neck with one of the swords.<br/>\nHis body moved like a whirlwind of death, slaughtering his own companions.<br/>\nThe ogres fought back valiantly, no match for Suteng with his enchanted [blades].<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;What is blades?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe laughter of Rallos Zek boomed across the plains as the lord of war appeared before Suteng and took the weapons from the ogre\'s hands.<br/>\nThe swords slashed into Suteng swiftly, killing him where he stood.<br/>\nThe lord of war spoke to the remaining ogres on the battlefield, explaining why he had [tested] Suteng.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;What is tested?<br/>\n<br/>\nHe also told them each that if they wished to wield the weapons, they would have to seek them out for they would be broken into pieces and spread across Norrath.<br/>\nThe blades would not be whole again until a suitable warrior found the pieces, and gained the red [scabbard].<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;What is scabbard?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe lord of war handed the smallest ogre the great red scabbard and told him that it was his charge, and the charge of his family, to test any warrior who wished to have it.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;hail Kargek Redblade.<br/>\n<br/>\nKargek Redblade looks up from his forge and says<br/>\n<br/>\nHello there, can I help you?<br/>\n<br/>\nYour eyes are drawn to an extremely large red sword scabbard strapped to his back with no sword in it.<br/>\nKargek speaks again, <br/>\n<br/>\nI said, can I help you or do you need help from Wenden?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;Who is Wenden?<br/>\n<br/>\nKargek Redblade points to the other side of the forge and says<br/>\n<br/>\nWenden is my partner.<br/>\nHe is standing right over there.<br/>\nIf it is a question about a weapon, he will probably have the answers.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;What is large red sword scabbard?<br/>\n<br/>\nKargek Redblade turns to look at you and says,<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is a family heirloom.<br/>\nI might tell you the story behind it if you do me a little favor.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;What is favor?<br/>\n<br/>\nAn associate of mine is wandering somewhere in the Feerrott.<br/>\nHis name is Oknoggin Stonesmacker.<br/>\nIf you will deliver this note to him, I would appreciate it. <br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;hail Oknoggin Stonesmacker<br/>\nYoo leave me \'lone!<br/>\nOknoggin Stonesmacker snatches the note from your hand and rips it open with his large hands. <br/>\n<br/>\nYou take dis to Kargek.<br/>\nHe want!<br/>\n<br/>\nOknoggin says, as he throws a tiny lute at you. <br/>\n<br/>\nYou gain experience!!<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you for delivering the note to my associate.<br/>\nTake this book -

Gonna babble off some stuff and then ask some questions if that is ok. First the babble:<br/>\n<br/>\nI\'m trying to work on my Champions armor. I am Ally to Coldain from pulling the kael entrance the last few levels. (EW side, just got to dubious with CoV last night so will probably start coming in WL side now)<br/>\n<br/>\nMy guild does Kael raids regularly, but I\'d also like to try to get some of Corroded Plate on my own while I xp and work faction if possible. <br/>\n<br/>\nI tried pulling the bank area from the north ramp last night (when warrior was still 44). Tried to pull the pair of lowcon giants just to the right when you come out of the tunnel, but they exhibited some creative pathing and brought more. This was a bad thing. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, that seems like a good spot to pull to, and when I came back to do CR there was actually a group pulling here. Does not appear that any wandering giants go through there. I saw a highcon patrolling the tunnel leading out west, so that one looks off limits. Which leaves the south part of the bank area, which I have heard of people pulling to but I did not check out as I was getting a little frustrated hehe.<br/>\n<br/>\nOK, so the questions:<br/>\n* Is there anywhere down there that I can pull singles(or lowcon-doubles to break spawn if need be) at the bank (or arena entrance) without adds?<br/>\n* Is there an easier spot to pull where the mobs will drop the corroded plate? From what I can gather its just bank and arena. I looked at the Arena entrance and doesnt look like anything single pullable and there are some that see invis right at entrance so no sliding by. Also think that one of the guys there (captain something) is a serious undercon that I cant handle.<br/>\n* If you look at warriors magelo in my sig, are there any pieces that can be easily upgraded while I quest this stuff? I\'m also going to be going on all the Hate runs that I can starting next level...<br/>\n<br/>\nme <br/>\n(pocket gnome)</t>','4d298738f8ca003a2f2ed7bbcc0a018b',0,'','6g6r1o7r',1,0,'',0,0,0,1,0,'',0),(1655,301,37,51,0,'68.61.123.121',1507071929,0,1,1,1,1,'','Re: Getting Corroded Plate from Bank Area in Kael','<t>Re: Getting Corroded Plate from Bank Area in Kael	  #1	[-]<br/>\n avatar<br/>\n<br/>\nPosts: 0<br/>\nDec 16 02 11:44 AM<br/>\nReply Quote More<br/>\nMy Recent Posts<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nQuote:<br/>\nIs there an easier spot to pull where the mobs will drop the corroded plate?

If you can get a raid force mid to high 50\'s do the plate cycle in the enc house, will result in the best drops. With higher level friends you might be able to do arena one group, but you would need a higher tank.

It only drops off Lt\'s. tho, and they have about a 1 in 5 or so drop rate, so it\'s forken slow. You also are going to have issues at 51 with a druid that low. If you can wait until 56 and get a truncheon of doom to cover slows, it\'s a lot more tolerable.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is no other place you can duo for armor until you have the armor really. I can duo arena at 61, but I\'m wearing stuff that\'s better than what drops there, so it\'s not really helpful to you.<br/>\n<br/>\nBank will provide what you need tho if that\'s the only way to get your stuff.

Our camp spot was on the 2nd floor, was getting bored of waiting for spawns so i wanted to see how fast we could clear the tower. cleared the tower names and all in no time. kept it this way for a bit, then all of a sudden i see this vamp just flying on the balcony, odd because of Trile the other named is always floating around the floor. I target him, sure enough its Heratius, I told my friends to come up to the top floor quickly as i wasn\'t sure how long he would stay up. I tagged him and we proceeded to take him down easily. I kind of jumped the gun on in, cleric was only 40m at the start and mage was 70ish. Sure enough Vlad popped on the balcony. By this time I was at half health, and the floors had repopped. I didn\'t have my vamp weaps on me to try it, kind of a bummer as this is the last piece i needed for the sheild.

Sat there for 3 hours after doing the rest of the quest. No spawn. Next day logged on (camped right on the balcony) full castle spawn. Pulled the two vamps on balcony and heratius spawned while we were killing those two. Killed heratius, Valdanov killed us. Ran back to castle, started clearing first floor. Valdanov shows up and we kill him. We called in some help for our second attempt on him. While we were medding on the hill outside castle. Heratius spawns. So we work our way up there and killed him again. 2 kills in about a half hour. <br/>\n<br/>\nAn important note. Heratius drops the ashes also. They have the same name. BUT get them identified. One id\'s as Heratius\' ashes and the correct ones ID as valdanov\'s ashes. So be careful if you see the ashes in bazaar for sale. make sure you or have someone cast identify on them.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also dont believe that valdanov or Heratius is KOS to the other vamps.

I got Heratis\'s ashes while helping a friend do this quest. They are Lore. So if I do see ashes in bazaar will I be able to buy the ashes even though they are lore if they are the correct ones? Ie can you hold both ashes at the same time, even though both have exact same name and are lore, as long as they are identified as different? <br/>\n<br/>\nI ask this because there is someone selling them in bazaar but I cannot buy because it says they are lore (I have heratis not valnovs on me already).
