# The Steel Warrior- EQ - File repository
This was a fun project of love for the EQ fan base of the warrior class.
THE ORIGNAL SITE WAS LONG GONE.
I pulled the data off of wayback machines and paid an army of college kids to copy and post into the new forum. Happy college kids. copy paste jobs rock!

The site was up a while and my when hosting did a container php upgrade the PHPBB forums broke. i tried to upgrade the phpbb but it got dorked up so badly that I was unable to upgrade the software to where it functioned any longer.
This is a repository of the images that the reboot site used on the wordpress platform

The wordpress database is jeremib5_ss_dbname318.sql
The phpbb data base is jeremib5_ss_dbname9cf.sql

The old hosting was php 5.4

Feel free to fork this and grab the data and keep the flame alive.
